CHAPTER
I
THE
TRAIL
OF
THE
MEAT
Dark
spruce
forest
frowned
on
either
side
the
frozen
waterway
The
trees
had
been
stripped
by
a
recent
wind
of
their
white
covering
of
frost
and
they
seemed
to
lean
towards
each
other
black
and
ominous
in
the
fading
light
A
vast
silence
reigned
over
the
land
The
land
itself
was
a
desolation
lifeless
without
movement
so
lone
and
cold
that
the
spirit
of
it
was
not
even
that
of
sadness
There
was
a
hint
in
it
of
laughter
but
of
a
laughter
more
terrible
than
any
sadness—a
laughter
that
was
mirthless
as
the
smile
of
the
sphinx
a
laughter
cold
as
the
frost
and
partaking
of
the
grimness
of
infallibility
It
was
the
masterful
and
incommunicable
wisdom
of
eternity
laughing
at
the
futility
of
life
and
the
effort
of
life
It
was
the
Wild
the
savage
frozenhearted
Northland
Wild
But
there
was
life
abroad
in
the
land
and
defiant
Down
the
frozen
waterway
toiled
a
string
of
wolfish
dogs
Their
bristly
fur
was
rimed
with
frost
Their
breath
froze
in
the
air
as
it
left
their
mouths
spouting
forth
in
spumes
of
vapour
that
settled
upon
the
hair
of
their
bodies
and
formed
into
crystals
of
frost
Leather
harness
was
on
the
dogs
and
leather
traces
attached
them
to
a
sled
which
dragged
along
behind
The
sled
was
without
runners
It
was
made
of
stout
birchbark
and
its
full
surface
rested
on
the
snow
The
front
end
of
the
sled
was
turned
up
like
a
scroll
in
order
to
force
down
and
under
the
bore
of
soft
snow
that
surged
like
a
wave
before
it
On
the
sled
securely
lashed
was
a
long
and
narrow
oblong
box
There
were
other
things
on
the
sled—blankets
an
axe
and
a
coffeepot
and
fryingpan
but
prominent
occupying
most
of
the
space
was
the
long
and
narrow
oblong
box
In
advance
of
the
dogs
on
wide
snowshoes
toiled
a
man
At
the
rear
of
the
sled
toiled
a
second
man
On
the
sled
in
the
box
lay
a
third
man
whose
toil
was
over—a
man
whom
the
Wild
had
conquered
and
beaten
down
until
he
would
never
move
nor
struggle
again
It
is
not
the
way
of
the
Wild
to
like
movement
Life
is
an
offence
to
it
for
life
is
movement
and
the
Wild
aims
always
to
destroy
movement
It
freezes
the
water
to
prevent
it
running
to
the
sea
it
drives
the
sap
out
of
the
trees
till
they
are
frozen
to
their
mighty
hearts
and
most
ferociously
and
terribly
of
all
does
the
Wild
harry
and
crush
into
submission
man—man
who
is
the
most
restless
of
life
ever
in
revolt
against
the
dictum
that
all
movement
must
in
the
end
come
to
the
cessation
of
movement
But
at
front
and
rear
unawed
and
indomitable
toiled
the
two
men
who
were
not
yet
dead
Their
bodies
were
covered
with
fur
and
softtanned
leather
Eyelashes
and
cheeks
and
lips
were
so
coated
with
the
crystals
from
their
frozen
breath
that
their
faces
were
not
discernible
This
gave
them
the
seeming
of
ghostly
masques
undertakers
in
a
spectral
world
at
the
funeral
of
some
ghost
But
under
it
all
they
were
men
penetrating
the
land
of
desolation
and
mockery
and
silence
puny
adventurers
bent
on
colossal
adventure
pitting
themselves
against
the
might
of
a
world
as
remote
and
alien
and
pulseless
as
the
abysses
of
space
They
travelled
on
without
speech
saving
their
breath
for
the
work
of
their
bodies
On
every
side
was
the
silence
pressing
upon
them
with
a
tangible
presence
It
affected
their
minds
as
the
many
atmospheres
of
deep
water
affect
the
body
of
the
diver
It
crushed
them
with
the
weight
of
unending
vastness
and
unalterable
decree
It
crushed
them
into
the
remotest
recesses
of
their
own
minds
pressing
out
of
them
like
juices
from
the
grape
all
the
false
ardours
and
exaltations
and
undue
selfvalues
of
the
human
soul
until
they
perceived
themselves
finite
and
small
specks
and
motes
moving
with
weak
cunning
and
little
wisdom
amidst
the
play
and
interplay
of
the
great
blind
elements
and
forces
An
hour
went
by
and
a
second
hour
The
pale
light
of
the
short
sunless
day
was
beginning
to
fade
when
a
faint
far
cry
arose
on
the
still
air
It
soared
upward
with
a
swift
rush
till
it
reached
its
topmost
note
where
it
persisted
palpitant
and
tense
and
then
slowly
died
away
It
might
have
been
a
lost
soul
wailing
had
it
not
been
invested
with
a
certain
sad
fierceness
and
hungry
eagerness
The
front
man
turned
his
head
until
his
eyes
met
the
eyes
of
the
man
behind
And
then
across
the
narrow
oblong
box
each
nodded
to
the
other
A
second
cry
arose
piercing
the
silence
with
needlelike
shrillness
Both
men
located
the
sound
It
was
to
the
rear
somewhere
in
the
snow
expanse
they
had
just
traversed
A
third
and
answering
cry
arose
also
to
the
rear
and
to
the
left
of
the
second
cry
“They’re
after
us
Bill”
said
the
man
at
the
front
His
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
unreal
and
he
had
spoken
with
apparent
effort
“Meat
is
scarce”
answered
his
comrade
“I
ain’t
seen
a
rabbit
sign
for
days”
Thereafter
they
spoke
no
more
though
their
ears
were
keen
for
the
huntingcries
that
continued
to
rise
behind
them
At
the
fall
of
darkness
they
swung
the
dogs
into
a
cluster
of
spruce
trees
on
the
edge
of
the
waterway
and
made
a
camp
The
coffin
at
the
side
of
the
fire
served
for
seat
and
table
The
wolfdogs
clustered
on
the
far
side
of
the
fire
snarled
and
bickered
among
themselves
but
evinced
no
inclination
to
stray
off
into
the
darkness
“Seems
to
me
Henry
they’re
stayin’
remarkable
close
to
camp”
Bill
commented
Henry
squatting
over
the
fire
and
settling
the
pot
of
coffee
with
a
piece
of
ice
nodded
Nor
did
he
speak
till
he
had
taken
his
seat
on
the
coffin
and
begun
to
eat
“They
know
where
their
hides
is
safe”
he
said
“They’d
sooner
eat
grub
than
be
grub
They’re
pretty
wise
them
dogs”
Bill
shook
his
head
“Oh
I
don’t
know”
His
comrade
looked
at
him
curiously
“First
time
I
ever
heard
you
say
anything
about
their
not
bein’
wise”
“Henry”
said
the
other
munching
with
deliberation
the
beans
he
was
eating
“did
you
happen
to
notice
the
way
them
dogs
kicked
up
when
I
was
afeedin’
’em”
“They
did
cut
up
more’n
usual”
Henry
acknowledged
“How
many
dogs
’ve
we
got
Henry”
“Six”
“Well
Henry
”
Bill
stopped
for
a
moment
in
order
that
his
words
might
gain
greater
significance
“As
I
was
sayin’
Henry
we’ve
got
six
dogs
I
took
six
fish
out
of
the
bag
I
gave
one
fish
to
each
dog
an’
Henry
I
was
one
fish
short”
“You
counted
wrong”
“We’ve
got
six
dogs”
the
other
reiterated
dispassionately
“I
took
out
six
fish
One
Ear
didn’t
get
no
fish
I
came
back
to
the
bag
afterward
an’
got
’m
his
fish”
“We’ve
only
got
six
dogs”
Henry
said
“Henry”
Bill
went
on
“I
won’t
say
they
was
all
dogs
but
there
was
seven
of
’m
that
got
fish”
Henry
stopped
eating
to
glance
across
the
fire
and
count
the
dogs
“There’s
only
six
now”
he
said
“I
saw
the
other
one
run
off
across
the
snow”
Bill
announced
with
cool
positiveness
“I
saw
seven”
Henry
looked
at
him
commiseratingly
and
said
“I’ll
be
almighty
glad
when
this
trip’s
over”
“What
d’ye
mean
by
that”
Bill
demanded
“I
mean
that
this
load
of
ourn
is
gettin’
on
your
nerves
an’
that
you’re
beginnin’
to
see
things”
“I
thought
of
that”
Bill
answered
gravely
“An’
so
when
I
saw
it
run
off
across
the
snow
I
looked
in
the
snow
an’
saw
its
tracks
Then
I
counted
the
dogs
an’
there
was
still
six
of
’em
The
tracks
is
there
in
the
snow
now
D’ye
want
to
look
at
’em
I’ll
show
’em
to
you”
Henry
did
not
reply
but
munched
on
in
silence
until
the
meal
finished
he
topped
it
with
a
final
cup
of
coffee
He
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
said
“Then
you’re
thinkin’
as
it
was—”
A
long
wailing
cry
fiercely
sad
from
somewhere
in
the
darkness
had
interrupted
him
He
stopped
to
listen
to
it
then
he
finished
his
sentence
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
toward
the
sound
of
the
cry
“—one
of
them”
Bill
nodded
“I’d
a
blame
sight
sooner
think
that
than
anything
else
You
noticed
yourself
the
row
the
dogs
made”
Cry
after
cry
and
answering
cries
were
turning
the
silence
into
a
bedlam
From
every
side
the
cries
arose
and
the
dogs
betrayed
their
fear
by
huddling
together
and
so
close
to
the
fire
that
their
hair
was
scorched
by
the
heat
Bill
threw
on
more
wood
before
lighting
his
pipe
“I’m
thinking
you’re
down
in
the
mouth
some”
Henry
said
“Henry
”
He
sucked
meditatively
at
his
pipe
for
some
time
before
he
went
on
“Henry
I
was
athinkin’
what
a
blame
sight
luckier
he
is
than
you
an’
me’ll
ever
be”
He
indicated
the
third
person
by
a
downward
thrust
of
the
thumb
to
the
box
on
which
they
sat
“You
an’
me
Henry
when
we
die
we’ll
be
lucky
if
we
get
enough
stones
over
our
carcases
to
keep
the
dogs
off
of
us”
“But
we
ain’t
got
people
an’
money
an’
all
the
rest
like
him”
Henry
rejoined
“Longdistance
funerals
is
somethin’
you
an’
me
can’t
exactly
afford”
“What
gets
me
Henry
is
what
a
chap
like
this
that’s
a
lord
or
something
in
his
own
country
and
that’s
never
had
to
bother
about
grub
nor
blankets
why
he
comes
abuttin’
round
the
Godforsaken
ends
of
the
earth—that’s
what
I
can’t
exactly
see”
“He
might
have
lived
to
a
ripe
old
age
if
he’d
stayed
at
home”
Henry
agreed
Bill
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
but
changed
his
mind
Instead
he
pointed
towards
the
wall
of
darkness
that
pressed
about
them
from
every
side
There
was
no
suggestion
of
form
in
the
utter
blackness
only
could
be
seen
a
pair
of
eyes
gleaming
like
live
coals
Henry
indicated
with
his
head
a
second
pair
and
a
third
A
circle
of
the
gleaming
eyes
had
drawn
about
their
camp
Now
and
again
a
pair
of
eyes
moved
or
disappeared
to
appear
again
a
moment
later
The
unrest
of
the
dogs
had
been
increasing
and
they
stampeded
in
a
surge
of
sudden
fear
to
the
near
side
of
the
fire
cringing
and
crawling
about
the
legs
of
the
men
In
the
scramble
one
of
the
dogs
had
been
overturned
on
the
edge
of
the
fire
and
it
had
yelped
with
pain
and
fright
as
the
smell
of
its
singed
coat
possessed
the
air
The
commotion
caused
the
circle
of
eyes
to
shift
restlessly
for
a
moment
and
even
to
withdraw
a
bit
but
it
settled
down
again
as
the
dogs
became
quiet
“Henry
it’s
a
blame
misfortune
to
be
out
of
ammunition”
Bill
had
finished
his
pipe
and
was
helping
his
companion
to
spread
the
bed
of
fur
and
blanket
upon
the
spruce
boughs
which
he
had
laid
over
the
snow
before
supper
Henry
grunted
and
began
unlacing
his
moccasins
“How
many
cartridges
did
you
say
you
had
left”
he
asked
“Three”
came
the
answer
“An’
I
wisht
’twas
three
hundred
Then
I’d
show
’em
what
for
damn
’em”
He
shook
his
fist
angrily
at
the
gleaming
eyes
and
began
securely
to
prop
his
moccasins
before
the
fire
“An’
I
wisht
this
cold
snap’d
break”
he
went
on
“It’s
ben
fifty
below
for
two
weeks
now
An’
I
wisht
I’d
never
started
on
this
trip
Henry
I
don’t
like
the
looks
of
it
I
don’t
feel
right
somehow
An’
while
I’m
wishin’
I
wisht
the
trip
was
over
an’
done
with
an’
you
an’
me
asittin’
by
the
fire
in
Fort
McGurry
just
about
now
an’
playing
cribbage—that’s
what
I
wisht”
Henry
grunted
and
crawled
into
bed
As
he
dozed
off
he
was
aroused
by
his
comrade’s
voice
“Say
Henry
that
other
one
that
come
in
an’
got
a
fish—why
didn’t
the
dogs
pitch
into
it
That’s
what’s
botherin’
me”
“You’re
botherin’
too
much
Bill”
came
the
sleepy
response
“You
was
never
like
this
before
You
jes’
shut
up
now
an’
go
to
sleep
an’
you’ll
be
all
hunkydory
in
the
mornin’
Your
stomach’s
sour
that’s
what’s
botherin’
you”
The
men
slept
breathing
heavily
side
by
side
under
the
one
covering
The
fire
died
down
and
the
gleaming
eyes
drew
closer
the
circle
they
had
flung
about
the
camp
The
dogs
clustered
together
in
fear
now
and
again
snarling
menacingly
as
a
pair
of
eyes
drew
close
Once
their
uproar
became
so
loud
that
Bill
woke
up
He
got
out
of
bed
carefully
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
sleep
of
his
comrade
and
threw
more
wood
on
the
fire
As
it
began
to
flame
up
the
circle
of
eyes
drew
farther
back
He
glanced
casually
at
the
huddling
dogs
He
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
at
them
more
sharply
Then
he
crawled
back
into
the
blankets
“Henry”
he
said
“Oh
Henry”
Henry
groaned
as
he
passed
from
sleep
to
waking
and
demanded
“What’s
wrong
now”
“Nothin’”
came
the
answer
“only
there’s
seven
of
’em
again
I
just
counted”
Henry
acknowledged
receipt
of
the
information
with
a
grunt
that
slid
into
a
snore
as
he
drifted
back
into
sleep
In
the
morning
it
was
Henry
who
awoke
first
and
routed
his
companion
out
of
bed
Daylight
was
yet
three
hours
away
though
it
was
already
six
o’clock
and
in
the
darkness
Henry
went
about
preparing
breakfast
while
Bill
rolled
the
blankets
and
made
the
sled
ready
for
lashing
“Say
Henry”
he
asked
suddenly
“how
many
dogs
did
you
say
we
had”
“Six”
“Wrong”
Bill
proclaimed
triumphantly
“Seven
again”
Henry
queried
“No
five
one’s
gone”
“The
hell”
Henry
cried
in
wrath
leaving
the
cooking
to
come
and
count
the
dogs
“You’re
right
Bill”
he
concluded
“Fatty’s
gone”
“An’
he
went
like
greased
lightnin’
once
he
got
started
Couldn’t
’ve
seen
’m
for
smoke”
“No
chance
at
all”
Henry
concluded
“They
jes’
swallowed
’m
alive
I
bet
he
was
yelpin’
as
he
went
down
their
throats
damn
’em”
“He
always
was
a
fool
dog”
said
Bill
“But
no
fool
dog
ought
to
be
fool
enough
to
go
off
an’
commit
suicide
that
way”
He
looked
over
the
remainder
of
the
team
with
a
speculative
eye
that
summed
up
instantly
the
salient
traits
of
each
animal
“I
bet
none
of
the
others
would
do
it”
“Couldn’t
drive
’em
away
from
the
fire
with
a
club”
Bill
agreed
“I
always
did
think
there
was
somethin’
wrong
with
Fatty
anyway”
And
this
was
the
epitaph
of
a
dead
dog
on
the
Northland
trail—less
scant
than
the
epitaph
of
many
another
dog
of
many
a
man
CHAPTER
II
THE
SHEWOLF
Breakfast
eaten
and
the
slim
campoutfit
lashed
to
the
sled
the
men
turned
their
backs
on
the
cheery
fire
and
launched
out
into
the
darkness
At
once
began
to
rise
the
cries
that
were
fiercely
sad—cries
that
called
through
the
darkness
and
cold
to
one
another
and
answered
back
Conversation
ceased
Daylight
came
at
nine
o’clock
At
midday
the
sky
to
the
south
warmed
to
rosecolour
and
marked
where
the
bulge
of
the
earth
intervened
between
the
meridian
sun
and
the
northern
world
But
the
rosecolour
swiftly
faded
The
grey
light
of
day
that
remained
lasted
until
three
o’clock
when
it
too
faded
and
the
pall
of
the
Arctic
night
descended
upon
the
lone
and
silent
land
As
darkness
came
on
the
huntingcries
to
right
and
left
and
rear
drew
closer—so
close
that
more
than
once
they
sent
surges
of
fear
through
the
toiling
dogs
throwing
them
into
shortlived
panics
At
the
conclusion
of
one
such
panic
when
he
and
Henry
had
got
the
dogs
back
in
the
traces
Bill
said
“I
wisht
they’d
strike
game
somewheres
an’
go
away
an’
leave
us
alone”
“They
do
get
on
the
nerves
horrible”
Henry
sympathised
They
spoke
no
more
until
camp
was
made
Henry
was
bending
over
and
adding
ice
to
the
babbling
pot
of
beans
when
he
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
a
blow
an
exclamation
from
Bill
and
a
sharp
snarling
cry
of
pain
from
among
the
dogs
He
straightened
up
in
time
to
see
a
dim
form
disappearing
across
the
snow
into
the
shelter
of
the
dark
Then
he
saw
Bill
standing
amid
the
dogs
half
triumphant
half
crestfallen
in
one
hand
a
stout
club
in
the
other
the
tail
and
part
of
the
body
of
a
suncured
salmon
“It
got
half
of
it”
he
announced
“but
I
got
a
whack
at
it
jes’
the
same
D’ye
hear
it
squeal”
“What’d
it
look
like”
Henry
asked
“Couldn’t
see
But
it
had
four
legs
an’
a
mouth
an’
hair
an’
looked
like
any
dog”
“Must
be
a
tame
wolf
I
reckon”
“It’s
damned
tame
whatever
it
is
comin’
in
here
at
feedin’
time
an’
gettin’
its
whack
of
fish”
That
night
when
supper
was
finished
and
they
sat
on
the
oblong
box
and
pulled
at
their
pipes
the
circle
of
gleaming
eyes
drew
in
even
closer
than
before
“I
wisht
they’d
spring
up
a
bunch
of
moose
or
something
an’
go
away
an’
leave
us
alone”
Bill
said
Henry
grunted
with
an
intonation
that
was
not
all
sympathy
and
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
sat
on
in
silence
Henry
staring
at
the
fire
and
Bill
at
the
circle
of
eyes
that
burned
in
the
darkness
just
beyond
the
firelight
“I
wisht
we
was
pullin’
into
McGurry
right
now”
he
began
again
“Shut
up
your
wishin’
and
your
croakin’”
Henry
burst
out
angrily
“Your
stomach’s
sour
That’s
what’s
ailin’
you
Swallow
a
spoonful
of
sody
an’
you’ll
sweeten
up
wonderful
an’
be
more
pleasant
company”
In
the
morning
Henry
was
aroused
by
fervid
blasphemy
that
proceeded
from
the
mouth
of
Bill
Henry
propped
himself
up
on
an
elbow
and
looked
to
see
his
comrade
standing
among
the
dogs
beside
the
replenished
fire
his
arms
raised
in
objurgation
his
face
distorted
with
passion
“Hello”
Henry
called
“What’s
up
now”
“Frog’s
gone”
came
the
answer
“No”
“I
tell
you
yes”
Henry
leaped
out
of
the
blankets
and
to
the
dogs
He
counted
them
with
care
and
then
joined
his
partner
in
cursing
the
power
of
the
Wild
that
had
robbed
them
of
another
dog
“Frog
was
the
strongest
dog
of
the
bunch”
Bill
pronounced
finally
“An’
he
was
no
fool
dog
neither”
Henry
added
And
so
was
recorded
the
second
epitaph
in
two
days
A
gloomy
breakfast
was
eaten
and
the
four
remaining
dogs
were
harnessed
to
the
sled
The
day
was
a
repetition
of
the
days
that
had
gone
before
The
men
toiled
without
speech
across
the
face
of
the
frozen
world
The
silence
was
unbroken
save
by
the
cries
of
their
pursuers
that
unseen
hung
upon
their
rear
With
the
coming
of
night
in
the
midafternoon
the
cries
sounded
closer
as
the
pursuers
drew
in
according
to
their
custom
and
the
dogs
grew
excited
and
frightened
and
were
guilty
of
panics
that
tangled
the
traces
and
further
depressed
the
two
men
“There
that’ll
fix
you
fool
critters”
Bill
said
with
satisfaction
that
night
standing
erect
at
completion
of
his
task
Henry
left
the
cooking
to
come
and
see
Not
only
had
his
partner
tied
the
dogs
up
but
he
had
tied
them
after
the
Indian
fashion
with
sticks
About
the
neck
of
each
dog
he
had
fastened
a
leather
thong
To
this
and
so
close
to
the
neck
that
the
dog
could
not
get
his
teeth
to
it
he
had
tied
a
stout
stick
four
or
five
feet
in
length
The
other
end
of
the
stick
in
turn
was
made
fast
to
a
stake
in
the
ground
by
means
of
a
leather
thong
The
dog
was
unable
to
gnaw
through
the
leather
at
his
own
end
of
the
stick
The
stick
prevented
him
from
getting
at
the
leather
that
fastened
the
other
end
Henry
nodded
his
head
approvingly
“It’s
the
only
contraption
that’ll
ever
hold
One
Ear”
he
said
“He
can
gnaw
through
leather
as
clean
as
a
knife
an’
jes’
about
half
as
quick
They
all’ll
be
here
in
the
mornin’
hunkydory”
“You
jes’
bet
they
will”
Bill
affirmed
“If
one
of
em’
turns
up
missin’
I’ll
go
without
my
coffee”
“They
jes’
know
we
ain’t
loaded
to
kill”
Henry
remarked
at
bedtime
indicating
the
gleaming
circle
that
hemmed
them
in
“If
we
could
put
a
couple
of
shots
into
’em
they’d
be
more
respectful
They
come
closer
every
night
Get
the
firelight
out
of
your
eyes
an’
look
hard—there
Did
you
see
that
one”
For
some
time
the
two
men
amused
themselves
with
watching
the
movement
of
vague
forms
on
the
edge
of
the
firelight
By
looking
closely
and
steadily
at
where
a
pair
of
eyes
burned
in
the
darkness
the
form
of
the
animal
would
slowly
take
shape
They
could
even
see
these
forms
move
at
times
A
sound
among
the
dogs
attracted
the
men’s
attention
One
Ear
was
uttering
quick
eager
whines
lunging
at
the
length
of
his
stick
toward
the
darkness
and
desisting
now
and
again
in
order
to
make
frantic
attacks
on
the
stick
with
his
teeth
“Look
at
that
Bill”
Henry
whispered
Full
into
the
firelight
with
a
stealthy
sidelong
movement
glided
a
doglike
animal
It
moved
with
commingled
mistrust
and
daring
cautiously
observing
the
men
its
attention
fixed
on
the
dogs
One
Ear
strained
the
full
length
of
the
stick
toward
the
intruder
and
whined
with
eagerness
“That
fool
One
Ear
don’t
seem
scairt
much”
Bill
said
in
a
low
tone
“It’s
a
shewolf”
Henry
whispered
back
“an’
that
accounts
for
Fatty
an’
Frog
She’s
the
decoy
for
the
pack
She
draws
out
the
dog
an’
then
all
the
rest
pitches
in
an’
eats
’m
up”
The
fire
crackled
A
log
fell
apart
with
a
loud
spluttering
noise
At
the
sound
of
it
the
strange
animal
leaped
back
into
the
darkness
“Henry
I’m
athinkin’”
Bill
announced
“Thinkin’
what”
“I’m
athinkin’
that
was
the
one
I
lambasted
with
the
club”
“Ain’t
the
slightest
doubt
in
the
world”
was
Henry’s
response
“An’
right
here
I
want
to
remark”
Bill
went
on
“that
that
animal’s
familyarity
with
campfires
is
suspicious
an’
immoral”
“It
knows
for
certain
more’n
a
selfrespectin’
wolf
ought
to
know”
Henry
agreed
“A
wolf
that
knows
enough
to
come
in
with
the
dogs
at
feedin’
time
has
had
experiences”
“Ol’
Villan
had
a
dog
once
that
run
away
with
the
wolves”
Bill
cogitates
aloud
“I
ought
to
know
I
shot
it
out
of
the
pack
in
a
moose
pasture
over
‘on
Little
Stick
An’
Ol’
Villan
cried
like
a
baby
Hadn’t
seen
it
for
three
years
he
said
Ben
with
the
wolves
all
that
time”
“I
reckon
you’ve
called
the
turn
Bill
That
wolf’s
a
dog
an’
it’s
eaten
fish
many’s
the
time
from
the
hand
of
man”
“An
if
I
get
a
chance
at
it
that
wolf
that’s
a
dog’ll
be
jes’
meat”
Bill
declared
“We
can’t
afford
to
lose
no
more
animals”
“But
you’ve
only
got
three
cartridges”
Henry
objected
“I’ll
wait
for
a
dead
sure
shot”
was
the
reply
In
the
morning
Henry
renewed
the
fire
and
cooked
breakfast
to
the
accompaniment
of
his
partner’s
snoring
“You
was
sleepin’
jes’
too
comfortable
for
anything”
Henry
told
him
as
he
routed
him
out
for
breakfast
“I
hadn’t
the
heart
to
rouse
you”
Bill
began
to
eat
sleepily
He
noticed
that
his
cup
was
empty
and
started
to
reach
for
the
pot
But
the
pot
was
beyond
arm’s
length
and
beside
Henry
“Say
Henry”
he
chided
gently
“ain’t
you
forgot
somethin’”
Henry
looked
about
with
great
carefulness
and
shook
his
head
Bill
held
up
the
empty
cup
“You
don’t
get
no
coffee”
Henry
announced
“Ain’t
run
out”
Bill
asked
anxiously
“Nope”
“Ain’t
thinkin’
it’ll
hurt
my
digestion”
“Nope”
A
flush
of
angry
blood
pervaded
Bill’s
face
“Then
it’s
jes’
warm
an’
anxious
I
am
to
be
hearin’
you
explain
yourself”
he
said
“Spanker’s
gone”
Henry
answered
Without
haste
with
the
air
of
one
resigned
to
misfortune
Bill
turned
his
head
and
from
where
he
sat
counted
the
dogs
“How’d
it
happen”
he
asked
apathetically
Henry
shrugged
his
shoulders
“Don’t
know
Unless
One
Ear
gnawed
’m
loose
He
couldn’t
adone
it
himself
that’s
sure”
“The
darned
cuss”
Bill
spoke
gravely
and
slowly
with
no
hint
of
the
anger
that
was
raging
within
“Jes’
because
he
couldn’t
chew
himself
loose
he
chews
Spanker
loose”
“Well
Spanker’s
troubles
is
over
anyway
I
guess
he’s
digested
by
this
time
an’
cavortin’
over
the
landscape
in
the
bellies
of
twenty
different
wolves”
was
Henry’s
epitaph
on
this
the
latest
lost
dog
“Have
some
coffee
Bill”
But
Bill
shook
his
head
“Go
on”
Henry
pleaded
elevating
the
pot
Bill
shoved
his
cup
aside
“I’ll
be
dingdongdanged
if
I
do
I
said
I
wouldn’t
if
ary
dog
turned
up
missin’
an’
I
won’t”
“It’s
darn
good
coffee”
Henry
said
enticingly
But
Bill
was
stubborn
and
he
ate
a
dry
breakfast
washed
down
with
mumbled
curses
at
One
Ear
for
the
trick
he
had
played
“I’ll
tie
’em
up
out
of
reach
of
each
other
tonight”
Bill
said
as
they
took
the
trail
They
had
travelled
little
more
than
a
hundred
yards
when
Henry
who
was
in
front
bent
down
and
picked
up
something
with
which
his
snowshoe
had
collided
It
was
dark
and
he
could
not
see
it
but
he
recognised
it
by
the
touch
He
flung
it
back
so
that
it
struck
the
sled
and
bounced
along
until
it
fetched
up
on
Bill’s
snowshoes
“Mebbe
you’ll
need
that
in
your
business”
Henry
said
Bill
uttered
an
exclamation
It
was
all
that
was
left
of
Spanker—the
stick
with
which
he
had
been
tied
“They
ate
’m
hide
an’
all”
Bill
announced
“The
stick’s
as
clean
as
a
whistle
They’ve
ate
the
leather
offen
both
ends
They’re
damn
hungry
Henry
an’
they’ll
have
you
an’
me
guessin’
before
this
trip’s
over”
Henry
laughed
defiantly
“I
ain’t
been
trailed
this
way
by
wolves
before
but
I’ve
gone
through
a
whole
lot
worse
an’
kept
my
health
Takes
more’n
a
handful
of
them
pesky
critters
to
do
for
yours
truly
Bill
my
son”
“I
don’t
know
I
don’t
know”
Bill
muttered
ominously
“Well
you’ll
know
all
right
when
we
pull
into
McGurry”
“I
ain’t
feelin’
special
enthusiastic”
Bill
persisted
“You’re
off
colour
that’s
what’s
the
matter
with
you”
Henry
dogmatised
“What
you
need
is
quinine
an’
I’m
goin’
to
dose
you
up
stiff
as
soon
as
we
make
McGurry”
Bill
grunted
his
disagreement
with
the
diagnosis
and
lapsed
into
silence
The
day
was
like
all
the
days
Light
came
at
nine
o’clock
At
twelve
o’clock
the
southern
horizon
was
warmed
by
the
unseen
sun
and
then
began
the
cold
grey
of
afternoon
that
would
merge
three
hours
later
into
night
It
was
just
after
the
sun’s
futile
effort
to
appear
that
Bill
slipped
the
rifle
from
under
the
sledlashings
and
said
“You
keep
right
on
Henry
I’m
goin’
to
see
what
I
can
see”
“You’d
better
stick
by
the
sled”
his
partner
protested
“You’ve
only
got
three
cartridges
an’
there’s
no
tellin’
what
might
happen”
“Who’s
croaking
now”
Bill
demanded
triumphantly
Henry
made
no
reply
and
plodded
on
alone
though
often
he
cast
anxious
glances
back
into
the
grey
solitude
where
his
partner
had
disappeared
An
hour
later
taking
advantage
of
the
cutoffs
around
which
the
sled
had
to
go
Bill
arrived
“They’re
scattered
an’
rangin’
along
wide”
he
said
“keeping
up
with
us
an’
lookin’
for
game
at
the
same
time
You
see
they’re
sure
of
us
only
they
know
they’ve
got
to
wait
to
get
us
In
the
meantime
they’re
willin’
to
pick
up
anything
eatable
that
comes
handy”
“You
mean
they
think
they’re
sure
of
us”
Henry
objected
pointedly
But
Bill
ignored
him
“I
seen
some
of
them
They’re
pretty
thin
They
ain’t
had
a
bite
in
weeks
I
reckon
outside
of
Fatty
an’
Frog
an’
Spanker
an’
there’s
so
many
of
’em
that
that
didn’t
go
far
They’re
remarkable
thin
Their
ribs
is
like
washboards
an’
their
stomachs
is
right
up
against
their
backbones
They’re
pretty
desperate
I
can
tell
you
They’ll
be
goin’
mad
yet
an’
then
watch
out”
A
few
minutes
later
Henry
who
was
now
travelling
behind
the
sled
emitted
a
low
warning
whistle
Bill
turned
and
looked
then
quietly
stopped
the
dogs
To
the
rear
from
around
the
last
bend
and
plainly
into
view
on
the
very
trail
they
had
just
covered
trotted
a
furry
slinking
form
Its
nose
was
to
the
trail
and
it
trotted
with
a
peculiar
sliding
effortless
gait
When
they
halted
it
halted
throwing
up
its
head
and
regarding
them
steadily
with
nostrils
that
twitched
as
it
caught
and
studied
the
scent
of
them
“It’s
the
shewolf”
Bill
answered
The
dogs
had
lain
down
in
the
snow
and
he
walked
past
them
to
join
his
partner
in
the
sled
Together
they
watched
the
strange
animal
that
had
pursued
them
for
days
and
that
had
already
accomplished
the
destruction
of
half
their
dogteam
After
a
searching
scrutiny
the
animal
trotted
forward
a
few
steps
This
it
repeated
several
times
till
it
was
a
short
hundred
yards
away
It
paused
head
up
close
by
a
clump
of
spruce
trees
and
with
sight
and
scent
studied
the
outfit
of
the
watching
men
It
looked
at
them
in
a
strangely
wistful
way
after
the
manner
of
a
dog
but
in
its
wistfulness
there
was
none
of
the
dog
affection
It
was
a
wistfulness
bred
of
hunger
as
cruel
as
its
own
fangs
as
merciless
as
the
frost
itself
It
was
large
for
a
wolf
its
gaunt
frame
advertising
the
lines
of
an
animal
that
was
among
the
largest
of
its
kind
“Stands
pretty
close
to
two
feet
an’
a
half
at
the
shoulders”
Henry
commented
“An’
I’ll
bet
it
ain’t
far
from
five
feet
long”
“Kind
of
strange
colour
for
a
wolf”
was
Bill’s
criticism
“I
never
seen
a
red
wolf
before
Looks
almost
cinnamon
to
me”
The
animal
was
certainly
not
cinnamoncoloured
Its
coat
was
the
true
wolfcoat
The
dominant
colour
was
grey
and
yet
there
was
to
it
a
faint
reddish
hue—a
hue
that
was
baffling
that
appeared
and
disappeared
that
was
more
like
an
illusion
of
the
vision
now
grey
distinctly
grey
and
again
giving
hints
and
glints
of
a
vague
redness
of
colour
not
classifiable
in
terms
of
ordinary
experience
“Looks
for
all
the
world
like
a
big
husky
sleddog”
Bill
said
“I
wouldn’t
be
s’prised
to
see
it
wag
its
tail”
“Hello
you
husky”
he
called
“Come
here
you
whateveryournameis”
“Ain’t
a
bit
scairt
of
you”
Henry
laughed
Bill
waved
his
hand
at
it
threateningly
and
shouted
loudly
but
the
animal
betrayed
no
fear
The
only
change
in
it
that
they
could
notice
was
an
accession
of
alertness
It
still
regarded
them
with
the
merciless
wistfulness
of
hunger
They
were
meat
and
it
was
hungry
and
it
would
like
to
go
in
and
eat
them
if
it
dared
“Look
here
Henry”
Bill
said
unconsciously
lowering
his
voice
to
a
whisper
because
of
what
he
imitated
“We’ve
got
three
cartridges
But
it’s
a
dead
shot
Couldn’t
miss
it
It’s
got
away
with
three
of
our
dogs
an’
we
oughter
put
a
stop
to
it
What
d’ye
say”
Henry
nodded
his
consent
Bill
cautiously
slipped
the
gun
from
under
the
sledlashing
The
gun
was
on
the
way
to
his
shoulder
but
it
never
got
there
For
in
that
instant
the
shewolf
leaped
sidewise
from
the
trail
into
the
clump
of
spruce
trees
and
disappeared
The
two
men
looked
at
each
other
Henry
whistled
long
and
comprehendingly
“I
might
have
knowed
it”
Bill
chided
himself
aloud
as
he
replaced
the
gun
“Of
course
a
wolf
that
knows
enough
to
come
in
with
the
dogs
at
feedin’
time
’d
know
all
about
shootingirons
I
tell
you
right
now
Henry
that
critter’s
the
cause
of
all
our
trouble
We’d
have
six
dogs
at
the
present
time
’stead
of
three
if
it
wasn’t
for
her
An’
I
tell
you
right
now
Henry
I’m
goin’
to
get
her
She’s
too
smart
to
be
shot
in
the
open
But
I’m
goin’
to
lay
for
her
I’ll
bushwhack
her
as
sure
as
my
name
is
Bill”
“You
needn’t
stray
off
too
far
in
doin’
it”
his
partner
admonished
“If
that
pack
ever
starts
to
jump
you
them
three
cartridges’d
be
wuth
no
more’n
three
whoops
in
hell
Them
animals
is
damn
hungry
an’
once
they
start
in
they’ll
sure
get
you
Bill”
They
camped
early
that
night
Three
dogs
could
not
drag
the
sled
so
fast
nor
for
so
long
hours
as
could
six
and
they
were
showing
unmistakable
signs
of
playing
out
And
the
men
went
early
to
bed
Bill
first
seeing
to
it
that
the
dogs
were
tied
out
of
gnawingreach
of
one
another
But
the
wolves
were
growing
bolder
and
the
men
were
aroused
more
than
once
from
their
sleep
So
near
did
the
wolves
approach
that
the
dogs
became
frantic
with
terror
and
it
was
necessary
to
replenish
the
fire
from
time
to
time
in
order
to
keep
the
adventurous
marauders
at
safer
distance
“I’ve
hearn
sailors
talk
of
sharks
followin’
a
ship”
Bill
remarked
as
he
crawled
back
into
the
blankets
after
one
such
replenishing
of
the
fire
“Well
them
wolves
is
land
sharks
They
know
their
business
better’n
we
do
an’
they
ain’t
aholdin’
our
trail
this
way
for
their
health
They’re
goin’
to
get
us
They’re
sure
goin’
to
get
us
Henry”
“They’ve
half
got
you
a’ready
atalkin’
like
that”
Henry
retorted
sharply
“A
man’s
half
licked
when
he
says
he
is
An’
you’re
half
eaten
from
the
way
you’re
goin’
on
about
it”
“They’ve
got
away
with
better
men
than
you
an’
me”
Bill
answered
“Oh
shet
up
your
croakin’
You
make
me
allfired
tired”
Henry
rolled
over
angrily
on
his
side
but
was
surprised
that
Bill
made
no
similar
display
of
temper
This
was
not
Bill’s
way
for
he
was
easily
angered
by
sharp
words
Henry
thought
long
over
it
before
he
went
to
sleep
and
as
his
eyelids
fluttered
down
and
he
dozed
off
the
thought
in
his
mind
was
“There’s
no
mistakin’
it
Bill’s
almighty
blue
I’ll
have
to
cheer
him
up
tomorrow”
CHAPTER
III
THE
HUNGER
CRY
The
day
began
auspiciously
They
had
lost
no
dogs
during
the
night
and
they
swung
out
upon
the
trail
and
into
the
silence
the
darkness
and
the
cold
with
spirits
that
were
fairly
light
Bill
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
forebodings
of
the
previous
night
and
even
waxed
facetious
with
the
dogs
when
at
midday
they
overturned
the
sled
on
a
bad
piece
of
trail
It
was
an
awkward
mixup
The
sled
was
upside
down
and
jammed
between
a
treetrunk
and
a
huge
rock
and
they
were
forced
to
unharness
the
dogs
in
order
to
straighten
out
the
tangle
The
two
men
were
bent
over
the
sled
and
trying
to
right
it
when
Henry
observed
One
Ear
sidling
away
“Here
you
One
Ear”
he
cried
straightening
up
and
turning
around
on
the
dog
But
One
Ear
broke
into
a
run
across
the
snow
his
traces
trailing
behind
him
And
there
out
in
the
snow
of
their
back
track
was
the
shewolf
waiting
for
him
As
he
neared
her
he
became
suddenly
cautious
He
slowed
down
to
an
alert
and
mincing
walk
and
then
stopped
He
regarded
her
carefully
and
dubiously
yet
desirefully
She
seemed
to
smile
at
him
showing
her
teeth
in
an
ingratiating
rather
than
a
menacing
way
She
moved
toward
him
a
few
steps
playfully
and
then
halted
One
Ear
drew
near
to
her
still
alert
and
cautious
his
tail
and
ears
in
the
air
his
head
held
high
He
tried
to
sniff
noses
with
her
but
she
retreated
playfully
and
coyly
Every
advance
on
his
part
was
accompanied
by
a
corresponding
retreat
on
her
part
Step
by
step
she
was
luring
him
away
from
the
security
of
his
human
companionship
Once
as
though
a
warning
had
in
vague
ways
flitted
through
his
intelligence
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
back
at
the
overturned
sled
at
his
teammates
and
at
the
two
men
who
were
calling
to
him
But
whatever
idea
was
forming
in
his
mind
was
dissipated
by
the
shewolf
who
advanced
upon
him
sniffed
noses
with
him
for
a
fleeting
instant
and
then
resumed
her
coy
retreat
before
his
renewed
advances
In
the
meantime
Bill
had
bethought
himself
of
the
rifle
But
it
was
jammed
beneath
the
overturned
sled
and
by
the
time
Henry
had
helped
him
to
right
the
load
One
Ear
and
the
shewolf
were
too
close
together
and
the
distance
too
great
to
risk
a
shot
Too
late
One
Ear
learned
his
mistake
Before
they
saw
the
cause
the
two
men
saw
him
turn
and
start
to
run
back
toward
them
Then
approaching
at
right
angles
to
the
trail
and
cutting
off
his
retreat
they
saw
a
dozen
wolves
lean
and
grey
bounding
across
the
snow
On
the
instant
the
shewolf’s
coyness
and
playfulness
disappeared
With
a
snarl
she
sprang
upon
One
Ear
He
thrust
her
off
with
his
shoulder
and
his
retreat
cut
off
and
still
intent
on
regaining
the
sled
he
altered
his
course
in
an
attempt
to
circle
around
to
it
More
wolves
were
appearing
every
moment
and
joining
in
the
chase
The
shewolf
was
one
leap
behind
One
Ear
and
holding
her
own
“Where
are
you
goin’”
Henry
suddenly
demanded
laying
his
hand
on
his
partner’s
arm
Bill
shook
it
off
“I
won’t
stand
it”
he
said
“They
ain’t
agoin’
to
get
any
more
of
our
dogs
if
I
can
help
it”
Gun
in
hand
he
plunged
into
the
underbrush
that
lined
the
side
of
the
trail
His
intention
was
apparent
enough
Taking
the
sled
as
the
centre
of
the
circle
that
One
Ear
was
making
Bill
planned
to
tap
that
circle
at
a
point
in
advance
of
the
pursuit
With
his
rifle
in
the
broad
daylight
it
might
be
possible
for
him
to
awe
the
wolves
and
save
the
dog
“Say
Bill”
Henry
called
after
him
“Be
careful
Don’t
take
no
chances”
Henry
sat
down
on
the
sled
and
watched
There
was
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
Bill
had
already
gone
from
sight
but
now
and
again
appearing
and
disappearing
amongst
the
underbrush
and
the
scattered
clumps
of
spruce
could
be
seen
One
Ear
Henry
judged
his
case
to
be
hopeless
The
dog
was
thoroughly
alive
to
its
danger
but
it
was
running
on
the
outer
circle
while
the
wolfpack
was
running
on
the
inner
and
shorter
circle
It
was
vain
to
think
of
One
Ear
so
outdistancing
his
pursuers
as
to
be
able
to
cut
across
their
circle
in
advance
of
them
and
to
regain
the
sled
The
different
lines
were
rapidly
approaching
a
point
Somewhere
out
there
in
the
snow
screened
from
his
sight
by
trees
and
thickets
Henry
knew
that
the
wolfpack
One
Ear
and
Bill
were
coming
together
All
too
quickly
far
more
quickly
than
he
had
expected
it
happened
He
heard
a
shot
then
two
shots
in
rapid
succession
and
he
knew
that
Bill’s
ammunition
was
gone
Then
he
heard
a
great
outcry
of
snarls
and
yelps
He
recognised
One
Ear’s
yell
of
pain
and
terror
and
he
heard
a
wolfcry
that
bespoke
a
stricken
animal
And
that
was
all
The
snarls
ceased
The
yelping
died
away
Silence
settled
down
again
over
the
lonely
land
He
sat
for
a
long
while
upon
the
sled
There
was
no
need
for
him
to
go
and
see
what
had
happened
He
knew
it
as
though
it
had
taken
place
before
his
eyes
Once
he
roused
with
a
start
and
hastily
got
the
axe
out
from
underneath
the
lashings
But
for
some
time
longer
he
sat
and
brooded
the
two
remaining
dogs
crouching
and
trembling
at
his
feet
At
last
he
arose
in
a
weary
manner
as
though
all
the
resilience
had
gone
out
of
his
body
and
proceeded
to
fasten
the
dogs
to
the
sled
He
passed
a
rope
over
his
shoulder
a
mantrace
and
pulled
with
the
dogs
He
did
not
go
far
At
the
first
hint
of
darkness
he
hastened
to
make
a
camp
and
he
saw
to
it
that
he
had
a
generous
supply
of
firewood
He
fed
the
dogs
cooked
and
ate
his
supper
and
made
his
bed
close
to
the
fire
But
he
was
not
destined
to
enjoy
that
bed
Before
his
eyes
closed
the
wolves
had
drawn
too
near
for
safety
It
no
longer
required
an
effort
of
the
vision
to
see
them
They
were
all
about
him
and
the
fire
in
a
narrow
circle
and
he
could
see
them
plainly
in
the
firelight
lying
down
sitting
up
crawling
forward
on
their
bellies
or
slinking
back
and
forth
They
even
slept
Here
and
there
he
could
see
one
curled
up
in
the
snow
like
a
dog
taking
the
sleep
that
was
now
denied
himself
He
kept
the
fire
brightly
blazing
for
he
knew
that
it
alone
intervened
between
the
flesh
of
his
body
and
their
hungry
fangs
His
two
dogs
stayed
close
by
him
one
on
either
side
leaning
against
him
for
protection
crying
and
whimpering
and
at
times
snarling
desperately
when
a
wolf
approached
a
little
closer
than
usual
At
such
moments
when
his
dogs
snarled
the
whole
circle
would
be
agitated
the
wolves
coming
to
their
feet
and
pressing
tentatively
forward
a
chorus
of
snarls
and
eager
yelps
rising
about
him
Then
the
circle
would
lie
down
again
and
here
and
there
a
wolf
would
resume
its
broken
nap
But
this
circle
had
a
continuous
tendency
to
draw
in
upon
him
Bit
by
bit
an
inch
at
a
time
with
here
a
wolf
bellying
forward
and
there
a
wolf
bellying
forward
the
circle
would
narrow
until
the
brutes
were
almost
within
springing
distance
Then
he
would
seize
brands
from
the
fire
and
hurl
them
into
the
pack
A
hasty
drawing
back
always
resulted
accompanied
by
angry
yelps
and
frightened
snarls
when
a
wellaimed
brand
struck
and
scorched
a
too
daring
animal
Morning
found
the
man
haggard
and
worn
wideeyed
from
want
of
sleep
He
cooked
breakfast
in
the
darkness
and
at
nine
o’clock
when
with
the
coming
of
daylight
the
wolfpack
drew
back
he
set
about
the
task
he
had
planned
through
the
long
hours
of
the
night
Chopping
down
young
saplings
he
made
them
crossbars
of
a
scaffold
by
lashing
them
high
up
to
the
trunks
of
standing
trees
Using
the
sledlashing
for
a
heaving
rope
and
with
the
aid
of
the
dogs
he
hoisted
the
coffin
to
the
top
of
the
scaffold
“They
got
Bill
an’
they
may
get
me
but
they’ll
sure
never
get
you
young
man”
he
said
addressing
the
dead
body
in
its
treesepulchre
Then
he
took
the
trail
the
lightened
sled
bounding
along
behind
the
willing
dogs
for
they
too
knew
that
safety
lay
open
in
the
gaining
of
Fort
McGurry
The
wolves
were
now
more
open
in
their
pursuit
trotting
sedately
behind
and
ranging
along
on
either
side
their
red
tongues
lolling
out
their
lean
sides
showing
the
undulating
ribs
with
every
movement
They
were
very
lean
mere
skinbags
stretched
over
bony
frames
with
strings
for
muscles—so
lean
that
Henry
found
it
in
his
mind
to
marvel
that
they
still
kept
their
feet
and
did
not
collapse
forthright
in
the
snow
He
did
not
dare
travel
until
dark
At
midday
not
only
did
the
sun
warm
the
southern
horizon
but
it
even
thrust
its
upper
rim
pale
and
golden
above
the
skyline
He
received
it
as
a
sign
The
days
were
growing
longer
The
sun
was
returning
But
scarcely
had
the
cheer
of
its
light
departed
than
he
went
into
camp
There
were
still
several
hours
of
grey
daylight
and
sombre
twilight
and
he
utilised
them
in
chopping
an
enormous
supply
of
firewood
With
night
came
horror
Not
only
were
the
starving
wolves
growing
bolder
but
lack
of
sleep
was
telling
upon
Henry
He
dozed
despite
himself
crouching
by
the
fire
the
blankets
about
his
shoulders
the
axe
between
his
knees
and
on
either
side
a
dog
pressing
close
against
him
He
awoke
once
and
saw
in
front
of
him
not
a
dozen
feet
away
a
big
grey
wolf
one
of
the
largest
of
the
pack
And
even
as
he
looked
the
brute
deliberately
stretched
himself
after
the
manner
of
a
lazy
dog
yawning
full
in
his
face
and
looking
upon
him
with
a
possessive
eye
as
if
in
truth
he
were
merely
a
delayed
meal
that
was
soon
to
be
eaten
This
certitude
was
shown
by
the
whole
pack
Fully
a
score
he
could
count
staring
hungrily
at
him
or
calmly
sleeping
in
the
snow
They
reminded
him
of
children
gathered
about
a
spread
table
and
awaiting
permission
to
begin
to
eat
And
he
was
the
food
they
were
to
eat
He
wondered
how
and
when
the
meal
would
begin
As
he
piled
wood
on
the
fire
he
discovered
an
appreciation
of
his
own
body
which
he
had
never
felt
before
He
watched
his
moving
muscles
and
was
interested
in
the
cunning
mechanism
of
his
fingers
By
the
light
of
the
fire
he
crooked
his
fingers
slowly
and
repeatedly
now
one
at
a
time
now
all
together
spreading
them
wide
or
making
quick
gripping
movements
He
studied
the
nailformation
and
prodded
the
fingertips
now
sharply
and
again
softly
gauging
the
while
the
nervesensations
produced
It
fascinated
him
and
he
grew
suddenly
fond
of
this
subtle
flesh
of
his
that
worked
so
beautifully
and
smoothly
and
delicately
Then
he
would
cast
a
glance
of
fear
at
the
wolfcircle
drawn
expectantly
about
him
and
like
a
blow
the
realisation
would
strike
him
that
this
wonderful
body
of
his
this
living
flesh
was
no
more
than
so
much
meat
a
quest
of
ravenous
animals
to
be
torn
and
slashed
by
their
hungry
fangs
to
be
sustenance
to
them
as
the
moose
and
the
rabbit
had
often
been
sustenance
to
him
He
came
out
of
a
doze
that
was
half
nightmare
to
see
the
redhued
shewolf
before
him
She
was
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
feet
away
sitting
in
the
snow
and
wistfully
regarding
him
The
two
dogs
were
whimpering
and
snarling
at
his
feet
but
she
took
no
notice
of
them
She
was
looking
at
the
man
and
for
some
time
he
returned
her
look
There
was
nothing
threatening
about
her
She
looked
at
him
merely
with
a
great
wistfulness
but
he
knew
it
to
be
the
wistfulness
of
an
equally
great
hunger
He
was
the
food
and
the
sight
of
him
excited
in
her
the
gustatory
sensations
Her
mouth
opened
the
saliva
drooled
forth
and
she
licked
her
chops
with
the
pleasure
of
anticipation
A
spasm
of
fear
went
through
him
He
reached
hastily
for
a
brand
to
throw
at
her
But
even
as
he
reached
and
before
his
fingers
had
closed
on
the
missile
she
sprang
back
into
safety
and
he
knew
that
she
was
used
to
having
things
thrown
at
her
She
had
snarled
as
she
sprang
away
baring
her
white
fangs
to
their
roots
all
her
wistfulness
vanishing
being
replaced
by
a
carnivorous
malignity
that
made
him
shudder
He
glanced
at
the
hand
that
held
the
brand
noticing
the
cunning
delicacy
of
the
fingers
that
gripped
it
how
they
adjusted
themselves
to
all
the
inequalities
of
the
surface
curling
over
and
under
and
about
the
rough
wood
and
one
little
finger
too
close
to
the
burning
portion
of
the
brand
sensitively
and
automatically
writhing
back
from
the
hurtful
heat
to
a
cooler
grippingplace
and
in
the
same
instant
he
seemed
to
see
a
vision
of
those
same
sensitive
and
delicate
fingers
being
crushed
and
torn
by
the
white
teeth
of
the
shewolf
Never
had
he
been
so
fond
of
this
body
of
his
as
now
when
his
tenure
of
it
was
so
precarious
All
night
with
burning
brands
he
fought
off
the
hungry
pack
When
he
dozed
despite
himself
the
whimpering
and
snarling
of
the
dogs
aroused
him
Morning
came
but
for
the
first
time
the
light
of
day
failed
to
scatter
the
wolves
The
man
waited
in
vain
for
them
to
go
They
remained
in
a
circle
about
him
and
his
fire
displaying
an
arrogance
of
possession
that
shook
his
courage
born
of
the
morning
light
He
made
one
desperate
attempt
to
pull
out
on
the
trail
But
the
moment
he
left
the
protection
of
the
fire
the
boldest
wolf
leaped
for
him
but
leaped
short
He
saved
himself
by
springing
back
the
jaws
snapping
together
a
scant
six
inches
from
his
thigh
The
rest
of
the
pack
was
now
up
and
surging
upon
him
and
a
throwing
of
firebrands
right
and
left
was
necessary
to
drive
them
back
to
a
respectful
distance
Even
in
the
daylight
he
did
not
dare
leave
the
fire
to
chop
fresh
wood
Twenty
feet
away
towered
a
huge
dead
spruce
He
spent
half
the
day
extending
his
campfire
to
the
tree
at
any
moment
a
half
dozen
burning
faggots
ready
at
hand
to
fling
at
his
enemies
Once
at
the
tree
he
studied
the
surrounding
forest
in
order
to
fell
the
tree
in
the
direction
of
the
most
firewood
The
night
was
a
repetition
of
the
night
before
save
that
the
need
for
sleep
was
becoming
overpowering
The
snarling
of
his
dogs
was
losing
its
efficacy
Besides
they
were
snarling
all
the
time
and
his
benumbed
and
drowsy
senses
no
longer
took
note
of
changing
pitch
and
intensity
He
awoke
with
a
start
The
shewolf
was
less
than
a
yard
from
him
Mechanically
at
short
range
without
letting
go
of
it
he
thrust
a
brand
full
into
her
open
and
snarling
mouth
She
sprang
away
yelling
with
pain
and
while
he
took
delight
in
the
smell
of
burning
flesh
and
hair
he
watched
her
shaking
her
head
and
growling
wrathfully
a
score
of
feet
away
But
this
time
before
he
dozed
again
he
tied
a
burning
pineknot
to
his
right
hand
His
eyes
were
closed
but
few
minutes
when
the
burn
of
the
flame
on
his
flesh
awakened
him
For
several
hours
he
adhered
to
this
programme
Every
time
he
was
thus
awakened
he
drove
back
the
wolves
with
flying
brands
replenished
the
fire
and
rearranged
the
pineknot
on
his
hand
All
worked
well
but
there
came
a
time
when
he
fastened
the
pineknot
insecurely
As
his
eyes
closed
it
fell
away
from
his
hand
He
dreamed
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
in
Fort
McGurry
It
was
warm
and
comfortable
and
he
was
playing
cribbage
with
the
Factor
Also
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
fort
was
besieged
by
wolves
They
were
howling
at
the
very
gates
and
sometimes
he
and
the
Factor
paused
from
the
game
to
listen
and
laugh
at
the
futile
efforts
of
the
wolves
to
get
in
And
then
so
strange
was
the
dream
there
was
a
crash
The
door
was
burst
open
He
could
see
the
wolves
flooding
into
the
big
livingroom
of
the
fort
They
were
leaping
straight
for
him
and
the
Factor
With
the
bursting
open
of
the
door
the
noise
of
their
howling
had
increased
tremendously
This
howling
now
bothered
him
His
dream
was
merging
into
something
else—he
knew
not
what
but
through
it
all
following
him
persisted
the
howling
And
then
he
awoke
to
find
the
howling
real
There
was
a
great
snarling
and
yelping
The
wolves
were
rushing
him
They
were
all
about
him
and
upon
him
The
teeth
of
one
had
closed
upon
his
arm
Instinctively
he
leaped
into
the
fire
and
as
he
leaped
he
felt
the
sharp
slash
of
teeth
that
tore
through
the
flesh
of
his
leg
Then
began
a
fire
fight
His
stout
mittens
temporarily
protected
his
hands
and
he
scooped
live
coals
into
the
air
in
all
directions
until
the
campfire
took
on
the
semblance
of
a
volcano
But
it
could
not
last
long
His
face
was
blistering
in
the
heat
his
eyebrows
and
lashes
were
singed
off
and
the
heat
was
becoming
unbearable
to
his
feet
With
a
flaming
brand
in
each
hand
he
sprang
to
the
edge
of
the
fire
The
wolves
had
been
driven
back
On
every
side
wherever
the
live
coals
had
fallen
the
snow
was
sizzling
and
every
little
while
a
retiring
wolf
with
wild
leap
and
snort
and
snarl
announced
that
one
such
live
coal
had
been
stepped
upon
Flinging
his
brands
at
the
nearest
of
his
enemies
the
man
thrust
his
smouldering
mittens
into
the
snow
and
stamped
about
to
cool
his
feet
His
two
dogs
were
missing
and
he
well
knew
that
they
had
served
as
a
course
in
the
protracted
meal
which
had
begun
days
before
with
Fatty
the
last
course
of
which
would
likely
be
himself
in
the
days
to
follow
“You
ain’t
got
me
yet”
he
cried
savagely
shaking
his
fist
at
the
hungry
beasts
and
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
whole
circle
was
agitated
there
was
a
general
snarl
and
the
shewolf
slid
up
close
to
him
across
the
snow
and
watched
him
with
hungry
wistfulness
He
set
to
work
to
carry
out
a
new
idea
that
had
come
to
him
He
extended
the
fire
into
a
large
circle
Inside
this
circle
he
crouched
his
sleeping
outfit
under
him
as
a
protection
against
the
melting
snow
When
he
had
thus
disappeared
within
his
shelter
of
flame
the
whole
pack
came
curiously
to
the
rim
of
the
fire
to
see
what
had
become
of
him
Hitherto
they
had
been
denied
access
to
the
fire
and
they
now
settled
down
in
a
closedrawn
circle
like
so
many
dogs
blinking
and
yawning
and
stretching
their
lean
bodies
in
the
unaccustomed
warmth
Then
the
shewolf
sat
down
pointed
her
nose
at
a
star
and
began
to
howl
One
by
one
the
wolves
joined
her
till
the
whole
pack
on
haunches
with
noses
pointed
skyward
was
howling
its
hunger
cry
Dawn
came
and
daylight
The
fire
was
burning
low
The
fuel
had
run
out
and
there
was
need
to
get
more
The
man
attempted
to
step
out
of
his
circle
of
flame
but
the
wolves
surged
to
meet
him
Burning
brands
made
them
spring
aside
but
they
no
longer
sprang
back
In
vain
he
strove
to
drive
them
back
As
he
gave
up
and
stumbled
inside
his
circle
a
wolf
leaped
for
him
missed
and
landed
with
all
four
feet
in
the
coals
It
cried
out
with
terror
at
the
same
time
snarling
and
scrambled
back
to
cool
its
paws
in
the
snow
The
man
sat
down
on
his
blankets
in
a
crouching
position
His
body
leaned
forward
from
the
hips
His
shoulders
relaxed
and
drooping
and
his
head
on
his
knees
advertised
that
he
had
given
up
the
struggle
Now
and
again
he
raised
his
head
to
note
the
dying
down
of
the
fire
The
circle
of
flame
and
coals
was
breaking
into
segments
with
openings
in
between
These
openings
grew
in
size
the
segments
diminished
“I
guess
you
can
come
an’
get
me
any
time”
he
mumbled
“Anyway
I’m
goin’
to
sleep”
Once
he
awakened
and
in
an
opening
in
the
circle
directly
in
front
of
him
he
saw
the
shewolf
gazing
at
him
Again
he
awakened
a
little
later
though
it
seemed
hours
to
him
A
mysterious
change
had
taken
place—so
mysterious
a
change
that
he
was
shocked
wider
awake
Something
had
happened
He
could
not
understand
at
first
Then
he
discovered
it
The
wolves
were
gone
Remained
only
the
trampled
snow
to
show
how
closely
they
had
pressed
him
Sleep
was
welling
up
and
gripping
him
again
his
head
was
sinking
down
upon
his
knees
when
he
roused
with
a
sudden
start
There
were
cries
of
men
and
churn
of
sleds
the
creaking
of
harnesses
and
the
eager
whimpering
of
straining
dogs
Four
sleds
pulled
in
from
the
river
bed
to
the
camp
among
the
trees
Half
a
dozen
men
were
about
the
man
who
crouched
in
the
centre
of
the
dying
fire
They
were
shaking
and
prodding
him
into
consciousness
He
looked
at
them
like
a
drunken
man
and
maundered
in
strange
sleepy
speech
“Red
shewolf
Come
in
with
the
dogs
at
feedin’
time
First
she
ate
the
dogfood
Then
she
ate
the
dogs
An’
after
that
she
ate
Bill
”
“Where’s
Lord
Alfred”
one
of
the
men
bellowed
in
his
ear
shaking
him
roughly
He
shook
his
head
slowly
“No
she
didn’t
eat
him
He’s
roostin’
in
a
tree
at
the
last
camp”
“Dead”
the
man
shouted
“An’
in
a
box”
Henry
answered
He
jerked
his
shoulder
petulantly
away
from
the
grip
of
his
questioner
“Say
you
lemme
alone
I’m
jes’
plump
tuckered
out
Goo’
night
everybody”
His
eyes
fluttered
and
went
shut
His
chin
fell
forward
on
his
chest
And
even
as
they
eased
him
down
upon
the
blankets
his
snores
were
rising
on
the
frosty
air
But
there
was
another
sound
Far
and
faint
it
was
in
the
remote
distance
the
cry
of
the
hungry
wolfpack
as
it
took
the
trail
of
other
meat
than
the
man
it
had
just
missed
PART
II
CHAPTER
I
THE
BATTLE
OF
THE
FANGS
It
was
the
shewolf
who
had
first
caught
the
sound
of
men’s
voices
and
the
whining
of
the
sleddogs
and
it
was
the
shewolf
who
was
first
to
spring
away
from
the
cornered
man
in
his
circle
of
dying
flame
The
pack
had
been
loath
to
forego
the
kill
it
had
hunted
down
and
it
lingered
for
several
minutes
making
sure
of
the
sounds
and
then
it
too
sprang
away
on
the
trail
made
by
the
shewolf
Running
at
the
forefront
of
the
pack
was
a
large
grey
wolf—one
of
its
several
leaders
It
was
he
who
directed
the
pack’s
course
on
the
heels
of
the
shewolf
It
was
he
who
snarled
warningly
at
the
younger
members
of
the
pack
or
slashed
at
them
with
his
fangs
when
they
ambitiously
tried
to
pass
him
And
it
was
he
who
increased
the
pace
when
he
sighted
the
shewolf
now
trotting
slowly
across
the
snow
She
dropped
in
alongside
by
him
as
though
it
were
her
appointed
position
and
took
the
pace
of
the
pack
He
did
not
snarl
at
her
nor
show
his
teeth
when
any
leap
of
hers
chanced
to
put
her
in
advance
of
him
On
the
contrary
he
seemed
kindly
disposed
toward
her—too
kindly
to
suit
her
for
he
was
prone
to
run
near
to
her
and
when
he
ran
too
near
it
was
she
who
snarled
and
showed
her
teeth
Nor
was
she
above
slashing
his
shoulder
sharply
on
occasion
At
such
times
he
betrayed
no
anger
He
merely
sprang
to
the
side
and
ran
stiffly
ahead
for
several
awkward
leaps
in
carriage
and
conduct
resembling
an
abashed
country
swain
This
was
his
one
trouble
in
the
running
of
the
pack
but
she
had
other
troubles
On
her
other
side
ran
a
gaunt
old
wolf
grizzled
and
marked
with
the
scars
of
many
battles
He
ran
always
on
her
right
side
The
fact
that
he
had
but
one
eye
and
that
the
left
eye
might
account
for
this
He
also
was
addicted
to
crowding
her
to
veering
toward
her
till
his
scarred
muzzle
touched
her
body
or
shoulder
or
neck
As
with
the
running
mate
on
the
left
she
repelled
these
attentions
with
her
teeth
but
when
both
bestowed
their
attentions
at
the
same
time
she
was
roughly
jostled
being
compelled
with
quick
snaps
to
either
side
to
drive
both
lovers
away
and
at
the
same
time
to
maintain
her
forward
leap
with
the
pack
and
see
the
way
of
her
feet
before
her
At
such
times
her
running
mates
flashed
their
teeth
and
growled
threateningly
across
at
each
other
They
might
have
fought
but
even
wooing
and
its
rivalry
waited
upon
the
more
pressing
hungerneed
of
the
pack
After
each
repulse
when
the
old
wolf
sheered
abruptly
away
from
the
sharptoothed
object
of
his
desire
he
shouldered
against
a
young
threeyearold
that
ran
on
his
blind
right
side
This
young
wolf
had
attained
his
full
size
and
considering
the
weak
and
famished
condition
of
the
pack
he
possessed
more
than
the
average
vigour
and
spirit
Nevertheless
he
ran
with
his
head
even
with
the
shoulder
of
his
oneeyed
elder
When
he
ventured
to
run
abreast
of
the
older
wolf
which
was
seldom
a
snarl
and
a
snap
sent
him
back
even
with
the
shoulder
again
Sometimes
however
he
dropped
cautiously
and
slowly
behind
and
edged
in
between
the
old
leader
and
the
shewolf
This
was
doubly
resented
even
triply
resented
When
she
snarled
her
displeasure
the
old
leader
would
whirl
on
the
threeyearold
Sometimes
she
whirled
with
him
And
sometimes
the
young
leader
on
the
left
whirled
too
At
such
times
confronted
by
three
sets
of
savage
teeth
the
young
wolf
stopped
precipitately
throwing
himself
back
on
his
haunches
with
forelegs
stiff
mouth
menacing
and
mane
bristling
This
confusion
in
the
front
of
the
moving
pack
always
caused
confusion
in
the
rear
The
wolves
behind
collided
with
the
young
wolf
and
expressed
their
displeasure
by
administering
sharp
nips
on
his
hindlegs
and
flanks
He
was
laying
up
trouble
for
himself
for
lack
of
food
and
short
tempers
went
together
but
with
the
boundless
faith
of
youth
he
persisted
in
repeating
the
manoeuvre
every
little
while
though
it
never
succeeded
in
gaining
anything
for
him
but
discomfiture
Had
there
been
food
lovemaking
and
fighting
would
have
gone
on
apace
and
the
packformation
would
have
been
broken
up
But
the
situation
of
the
pack
was
desperate
It
was
lean
with
longstanding
hunger
It
ran
below
its
ordinary
speed
At
the
rear
limped
the
weak
members
the
very
young
and
the
very
old
At
the
front
were
the
strongest
Yet
all
were
more
like
skeletons
than
fullbodied
wolves
Nevertheless
with
the
exception
of
the
ones
that
limped
the
movements
of
the
animals
were
effortless
and
tireless
Their
stringy
muscles
seemed
founts
of
inexhaustible
energy
Behind
every
steellike
contraction
of
a
muscle
lay
another
steellike
contraction
and
another
and
another
apparently
without
end
They
ran
many
miles
that
day
They
ran
through
the
night
And
the
next
day
found
them
still
running
They
were
running
over
the
surface
of
a
world
frozen
and
dead
No
life
stirred
They
alone
moved
through
the
vast
inertness
They
alone
were
alive
and
they
sought
for
other
things
that
were
alive
in
order
that
they
might
devour
them
and
continue
to
live
They
crossed
low
divides
and
ranged
a
dozen
small
streams
in
a
lowerlying
country
before
their
quest
was
rewarded
Then
they
came
upon
moose
It
was
a
big
bull
they
first
found
Here
was
meat
and
life
and
it
was
guarded
by
no
mysterious
fires
nor
flying
missiles
of
flame
Splay
hoofs
and
palmated
antlers
they
knew
and
they
flung
their
customary
patience
and
caution
to
the
wind
It
was
a
brief
fight
and
fierce
The
big
bull
was
beset
on
every
side
He
ripped
them
open
or
split
their
skulls
with
shrewdly
driven
blows
of
his
great
hoofs
He
crushed
them
and
broke
them
on
his
large
horns
He
stamped
them
into
the
snow
under
him
in
the
wallowing
struggle
But
he
was
foredoomed
and
he
went
down
with
the
shewolf
tearing
savagely
at
his
throat
and
with
other
teeth
fixed
everywhere
upon
him
devouring
him
alive
before
ever
his
last
struggles
ceased
or
his
last
damage
had
been
wrought
There
was
food
in
plenty
The
bull
weighed
over
eight
hundred
pounds—fully
twenty
pounds
of
meat
per
mouth
for
the
fortyodd
wolves
of
the
pack
But
if
they
could
fast
prodigiously
they
could
feed
prodigiously
and
soon
a
few
scattered
bones
were
all
that
remained
of
the
splendid
live
brute
that
had
faced
the
pack
a
few
hours
before
There
was
now
much
resting
and
sleeping
With
full
stomachs
bickering
and
quarrelling
began
among
the
younger
males
and
this
continued
through
the
few
days
that
followed
before
the
breakingup
of
the
pack
The
famine
was
over
The
wolves
were
now
in
the
country
of
game
and
though
they
still
hunted
in
pack
they
hunted
more
cautiously
cutting
out
heavy
cows
or
crippled
old
bulls
from
the
small
mooseherds
they
ran
across
There
came
a
day
in
this
land
of
plenty
when
the
wolfpack
split
in
half
and
went
in
different
directions
The
shewolf
the
young
leader
on
her
left
and
the
oneeyed
elder
on
her
right
led
their
half
of
the
pack
down
to
the
Mackenzie
River
and
across
into
the
lake
country
to
the
east
Each
day
this
remnant
of
the
pack
dwindled
Two
by
two
male
and
female
the
wolves
were
deserting
Occasionally
a
solitary
male
was
driven
out
by
the
sharp
teeth
of
his
rivals
In
the
end
there
remained
only
four
the
shewolf
the
young
leader
the
oneeyed
one
and
the
ambitious
threeyearold
The
shewolf
had
by
now
developed
a
ferocious
temper
Her
three
suitors
all
bore
the
marks
of
her
teeth
Yet
they
never
replied
in
kind
never
defended
themselves
against
her
They
turned
their
shoulders
to
her
most
savage
slashes
and
with
wagging
tails
and
mincing
steps
strove
to
placate
her
wrath
But
if
they
were
all
mildness
toward
her
they
were
all
fierceness
toward
one
another
The
threeyearold
grew
too
ambitious
in
his
fierceness
He
caught
the
oneeyed
elder
on
his
blind
side
and
ripped
his
ear
into
ribbons
Though
the
grizzled
old
fellow
could
see
only
on
one
side
against
the
youth
and
vigour
of
the
other
he
brought
into
play
the
wisdom
of
long
years
of
experience
His
lost
eye
and
his
scarred
muzzle
bore
evidence
to
the
nature
of
his
experience
He
had
survived
too
many
battles
to
be
in
doubt
for
a
moment
about
what
to
do
The
battle
began
fairly
but
it
did
not
end
fairly
There
was
no
telling
what
the
outcome
would
have
been
for
the
third
wolf
joined
the
elder
and
together
old
leader
and
young
leader
they
attacked
the
ambitious
threeyearold
and
proceeded
to
destroy
him
He
was
beset
on
either
side
by
the
merciless
fangs
of
his
erstwhile
comrades
Forgotten
were
the
days
they
had
hunted
together
the
game
they
had
pulled
down
the
famine
they
had
suffered
That
business
was
a
thing
of
the
past
The
business
of
love
was
at
hand—ever
a
sterner
and
crueller
business
than
that
of
foodgetting
And
in
the
meanwhile
the
shewolf
the
cause
of
it
all
sat
down
contentedly
on
her
haunches
and
watched
She
was
even
pleased
This
was
her
day—and
it
came
not
often—when
manes
bristled
and
fang
smote
fang
or
ripped
and
tore
the
yielding
flesh
all
for
the
possession
of
her
And
in
the
business
of
love
the
threeyearold
who
had
made
this
his
first
adventure
upon
it
yielded
up
his
life
On
either
side
of
his
body
stood
his
two
rivals
They
were
gazing
at
the
shewolf
who
sat
smiling
in
the
snow
But
the
elder
leader
was
wise
very
wise
in
love
even
as
in
battle
The
younger
leader
turned
his
head
to
lick
a
wound
on
his
shoulder
The
curve
of
his
neck
was
turned
toward
his
rival
With
his
one
eye
the
elder
saw
the
opportunity
He
darted
in
low
and
closed
with
his
fangs
It
was
a
long
ripping
slash
and
deep
as
well
His
teeth
in
passing
burst
the
wall
of
the
great
vein
of
the
throat
Then
he
leaped
clear
The
young
leader
snarled
terribly
but
his
snarl
broke
midmost
into
a
tickling
cough
Bleeding
and
coughing
already
stricken
he
sprang
at
the
elder
and
fought
while
life
faded
from
him
his
legs
going
weak
beneath
him
the
light
of
day
dulling
on
his
eyes
his
blows
and
springs
falling
shorter
and
shorter
And
all
the
while
the
shewolf
sat
on
her
haunches
and
smiled
She
was
made
glad
in
vague
ways
by
the
battle
for
this
was
the
lovemaking
of
the
Wild
the
sextragedy
of
the
natural
world
that
was
tragedy
only
to
those
that
died
To
those
that
survived
it
was
not
tragedy
but
realisation
and
achievement
When
the
young
leader
lay
in
the
snow
and
moved
no
more
One
Eye
stalked
over
to
the
shewolf
His
carriage
was
one
of
mingled
triumph
and
caution
He
was
plainly
expectant
of
a
rebuff
and
he
was
just
as
plainly
surprised
when
her
teeth
did
not
flash
out
at
him
in
anger
For
the
first
time
she
met
him
with
a
kindly
manner
She
sniffed
noses
with
him
and
even
condescended
to
leap
about
and
frisk
and
play
with
him
in
quite
puppyish
fashion
And
he
for
all
his
grey
years
and
sage
experience
behaved
quite
as
puppyishly
and
even
a
little
more
foolishly
Forgotten
already
were
the
vanquished
rivals
and
the
lovetale
redwritten
on
the
snow
Forgotten
save
once
when
old
One
Eye
stopped
for
a
moment
to
lick
his
stiffening
wounds
Then
it
was
that
his
lips
half
writhed
into
a
snarl
and
the
hair
of
his
neck
and
shoulders
involuntarily
bristled
while
he
half
crouched
for
a
spring
his
claws
spasmodically
clutching
into
the
snowsurface
for
firmer
footing
But
it
was
all
forgotten
the
next
moment
as
he
sprang
after
the
shewolf
who
was
coyly
leading
him
a
chase
through
the
woods
After
that
they
ran
side
by
side
like
good
friends
who
have
come
to
an
understanding
The
days
passed
by
and
they
kept
together
hunting
their
meat
and
killing
and
eating
it
in
common
After
a
time
the
shewolf
began
to
grow
restless
She
seemed
to
be
searching
for
something
that
she
could
not
find
The
hollows
under
fallen
trees
seemed
to
attract
her
and
she
spent
much
time
nosing
about
among
the
larger
snowpiled
crevices
in
the
rocks
and
in
the
caves
of
overhanging
banks
Old
One
Eye
was
not
interested
at
all
but
he
followed
her
goodnaturedly
in
her
quest
and
when
her
investigations
in
particular
places
were
unusually
protracted
he
would
lie
down
and
wait
until
she
was
ready
to
go
on
They
did
not
remain
in
one
place
but
travelled
across
country
until
they
regained
the
Mackenzie
River
down
which
they
slowly
went
leaving
it
often
to
hunt
game
along
the
small
streams
that
entered
it
but
always
returning
to
it
again
Sometimes
they
chanced
upon
other
wolves
usually
in
pairs
but
there
was
no
friendliness
of
intercourse
displayed
on
either
side
no
gladness
at
meeting
no
desire
to
return
to
the
packformation
Several
times
they
encountered
solitary
wolves
These
were
always
males
and
they
were
pressingly
insistent
on
joining
with
One
Eye
and
his
mate
This
he
resented
and
when
she
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
him
bristling
and
showing
her
teeth
the
aspiring
solitary
ones
would
back
off
turntail
and
continue
on
their
lonely
way
One
moonlight
night
running
through
the
quiet
forest
One
Eye
suddenly
halted
His
muzzle
went
up
his
tail
stiffened
and
his
nostrils
dilated
as
he
scented
the
air
One
foot
also
he
held
up
after
the
manner
of
a
dog
He
was
not
satisfied
and
he
continued
to
smell
the
air
striving
to
understand
the
message
borne
upon
it
to
him
One
careless
sniff
had
satisfied
his
mate
and
she
trotted
on
to
reassure
him
Though
he
followed
her
he
was
still
dubious
and
he
could
not
forbear
an
occasional
halt
in
order
more
carefully
to
study
the
warning
She
crept
out
cautiously
on
the
edge
of
a
large
open
space
in
the
midst
of
the
trees
For
some
time
she
stood
alone
Then
One
Eye
creeping
and
crawling
every
sense
on
the
alert
every
hair
radiating
infinite
suspicion
joined
her
They
stood
side
by
side
watching
and
listening
and
smelling
To
their
ears
came
the
sounds
of
dogs
wrangling
and
scuffling
the
guttural
cries
of
men
the
sharper
voices
of
scolding
women
and
once
the
shrill
and
plaintive
cry
of
a
child
With
the
exception
of
the
huge
bulks
of
the
skinlodges
little
could
be
seen
save
the
flames
of
the
fire
broken
by
the
movements
of
intervening
bodies
and
the
smoke
rising
slowly
on
the
quiet
air
But
to
their
nostrils
came
the
myriad
smells
of
an
Indian
camp
carrying
a
story
that
was
largely
incomprehensible
to
One
Eye
but
every
detail
of
which
the
shewolf
knew
She
was
strangely
stirred
and
sniffed
and
sniffed
with
an
increasing
delight
But
old
One
Eye
was
doubtful
He
betrayed
his
apprehension
and
started
tentatively
to
go
She
turned
and
touched
his
neck
with
her
muzzle
in
a
reassuring
way
then
regarded
the
camp
again
A
new
wistfulness
was
in
her
face
but
it
was
not
the
wistfulness
of
hunger
She
was
thrilling
to
a
desire
that
urged
her
to
go
forward
to
be
in
closer
to
that
fire
to
be
squabbling
with
the
dogs
and
to
be
avoiding
and
dodging
the
stumbling
feet
of
men
One
Eye
moved
impatiently
beside
her
her
unrest
came
back
upon
her
and
she
knew
again
her
pressing
need
to
find
the
thing
for
which
she
searched
She
turned
and
trotted
back
into
the
forest
to
the
great
relief
of
One
Eye
who
trotted
a
little
to
the
fore
until
they
were
well
within
the
shelter
of
the
trees
As
they
slid
along
noiseless
as
shadows
in
the
moonlight
they
came
upon
a
runway
Both
noses
went
down
to
the
footprints
in
the
snow
These
footprints
were
very
fresh
One
Eye
ran
ahead
cautiously
his
mate
at
his
heels
The
broad
pads
of
their
feet
were
spread
wide
and
in
contact
with
the
snow
were
like
velvet
One
Eye
caught
sight
of
a
dim
movement
of
white
in
the
midst
of
the
white
His
sliding
gait
had
been
deceptively
swift
but
it
was
as
nothing
to
the
speed
at
which
he
now
ran
Before
him
was
bounding
the
faint
patch
of
white
he
had
discovered
They
were
running
along
a
narrow
alley
flanked
on
either
side
by
a
growth
of
young
spruce
Through
the
trees
the
mouth
of
the
alley
could
be
seen
opening
out
on
a
moonlit
glade
Old
One
Eye
was
rapidly
overhauling
the
fleeing
shape
of
white
Bound
by
bound
he
gained
Now
he
was
upon
it
One
leap
more
and
his
teeth
would
be
sinking
into
it
But
that
leap
was
never
made
High
in
the
air
and
straight
up
soared
the
shape
of
white
now
a
struggling
snowshoe
rabbit
that
leaped
and
bounded
executing
a
fantastic
dance
there
above
him
in
the
air
and
never
once
returning
to
earth
One
Eye
sprang
back
with
a
snort
of
sudden
fright
then
shrank
down
to
the
snow
and
crouched
snarling
threats
at
this
thing
of
fear
he
did
not
understand
But
the
shewolf
coolly
thrust
past
him
She
poised
for
a
moment
then
sprang
for
the
dancing
rabbit
She
too
soared
high
but
not
so
high
as
the
quarry
and
her
teeth
clipped
emptily
together
with
a
metallic
snap
She
made
another
leap
and
another
Her
mate
had
slowly
relaxed
from
his
crouch
and
was
watching
her
He
now
evinced
displeasure
at
her
repeated
failures
and
himself
made
a
mighty
spring
upward
His
teeth
closed
upon
the
rabbit
and
he
bore
it
back
to
earth
with
him
But
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
suspicious
crackling
movement
beside
him
and
his
astonished
eye
saw
a
young
spruce
sapling
bending
down
above
him
to
strike
him
His
jaws
let
go
their
grip
and
he
leaped
backward
to
escape
this
strange
danger
his
lips
drawn
back
from
his
fangs
his
throat
snarling
every
hair
bristling
with
rage
and
fright
And
in
that
moment
the
sapling
reared
its
slender
length
upright
and
the
rabbit
soared
dancing
in
the
air
again
The
shewolf
was
angry
She
sank
her
fangs
into
her
mate’s
shoulder
in
reproof
and
he
frightened
unaware
of
what
constituted
this
new
onslaught
struck
back
ferociously
and
in
still
greater
fright
ripping
down
the
side
of
the
shewolf’s
muzzle
For
him
to
resent
such
reproof
was
equally
unexpected
to
her
and
she
sprang
upon
him
in
snarling
indignation
Then
he
discovered
his
mistake
and
tried
to
placate
her
But
she
proceeded
to
punish
him
roundly
until
he
gave
over
all
attempts
at
placation
and
whirled
in
a
circle
his
head
away
from
her
his
shoulders
receiving
the
punishment
of
her
teeth
In
the
meantime
the
rabbit
danced
above
them
in
the
air
The
shewolf
sat
down
in
the
snow
and
old
One
Eye
now
more
in
fear
of
his
mate
than
of
the
mysterious
sapling
again
sprang
for
the
rabbit
As
he
sank
back
with
it
between
his
teeth
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
sapling
As
before
it
followed
him
back
to
earth
He
crouched
down
under
the
impending
blow
his
hair
bristling
but
his
teeth
still
keeping
tight
hold
of
the
rabbit
But
the
blow
did
not
fall
The
sapling
remained
bent
above
him
When
he
moved
it
moved
and
he
growled
at
it
through
his
clenched
jaws
when
he
remained
still
it
remained
still
and
he
concluded
it
was
safer
to
continue
remaining
still
Yet
the
warm
blood
of
the
rabbit
tasted
good
in
his
mouth
It
was
his
mate
who
relieved
him
from
the
quandary
in
which
he
found
himself
She
took
the
rabbit
from
him
and
while
the
sapling
swayed
and
teetered
threateningly
above
her
she
calmly
gnawed
off
the
rabbit’s
head
At
once
the
sapling
shot
up
and
after
that
gave
no
more
trouble
remaining
in
the
decorous
and
perpendicular
position
in
which
nature
had
intended
it
to
grow
Then
between
them
the
shewolf
and
One
Eye
devoured
the
game
which
the
mysterious
sapling
had
caught
for
them
There
were
other
runways
and
alleys
where
rabbits
were
hanging
in
the
air
and
the
wolfpair
prospected
them
all
the
shewolf
leading
the
way
old
One
Eye
following
and
observant
learning
the
method
of
robbing
snares—a
knowledge
destined
to
stand
him
in
good
stead
in
the
days
to
come
CHAPTER
II
THE
LAIR
For
two
days
the
shewolf
and
One
Eye
hung
about
the
Indian
camp
He
was
worried
and
apprehensive
yet
the
camp
lured
his
mate
and
she
was
loath
to
depart
But
when
one
morning
the
air
was
rent
with
the
report
of
a
rifle
close
at
hand
and
a
bullet
smashed
against
a
tree
trunk
several
inches
from
One
Eye’s
head
they
hesitated
no
more
but
went
off
on
a
long
swinging
lope
that
put
quick
miles
between
them
and
the
danger
They
did
not
go
far—a
couple
of
days’
journey
The
shewolf’s
need
to
find
the
thing
for
which
she
searched
had
now
become
imperative
She
was
getting
very
heavy
and
could
run
but
slowly
Once
in
the
pursuit
of
a
rabbit
which
she
ordinarily
would
have
caught
with
ease
she
gave
over
and
lay
down
and
rested
One
Eye
came
to
her
but
when
he
touched
her
neck
gently
with
his
muzzle
she
snapped
at
him
with
such
quick
fierceness
that
he
tumbled
over
backward
and
cut
a
ridiculous
figure
in
his
effort
to
escape
her
teeth
Her
temper
was
now
shorter
than
ever
but
he
had
become
more
patient
than
ever
and
more
solicitous
And
then
she
found
the
thing
for
which
she
sought
It
was
a
few
miles
up
a
small
stream
that
in
the
summer
time
flowed
into
the
Mackenzie
but
that
then
was
frozen
over
and
frozen
down
to
its
rocky
bottom—a
dead
stream
of
solid
white
from
source
to
mouth
The
shewolf
was
trotting
wearily
along
her
mate
well
in
advance
when
she
came
upon
the
overhanging
high
claybank
She
turned
aside
and
trotted
over
to
it
The
wear
and
tear
of
spring
storms
and
melting
snows
had
underwashed
the
bank
and
in
one
place
had
made
a
small
cave
out
of
a
narrow
fissure
She
paused
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
looked
the
wall
over
carefully
Then
on
one
side
and
the
other
she
ran
along
the
base
of
the
wall
to
where
its
abrupt
bulk
merged
from
the
softerlined
landscape
Returning
to
the
cave
she
entered
its
narrow
mouth
For
a
short
three
feet
she
was
compelled
to
crouch
then
the
walls
widened
and
rose
higher
in
a
little
round
chamber
nearly
six
feet
in
diameter
The
roof
barely
cleared
her
head
It
was
dry
and
cosey
She
inspected
it
with
painstaking
care
while
One
Eye
who
had
returned
stood
in
the
entrance
and
patiently
watched
her
She
dropped
her
head
with
her
nose
to
the
ground
and
directed
toward
a
point
near
to
her
closely
bunched
feet
and
around
this
point
she
circled
several
times
then
with
a
tired
sigh
that
was
almost
a
grunt
she
curled
her
body
in
relaxed
her
legs
and
dropped
down
her
head
toward
the
entrance
One
Eye
with
pointed
interested
ears
laughed
at
her
and
beyond
outlined
against
the
white
light
she
could
see
the
brush
of
his
tail
waving
goodnaturedly
Her
own
ears
with
a
snuggling
movement
laid
their
sharp
points
backward
and
down
against
the
head
for
a
moment
while
her
mouth
opened
and
her
tongue
lolled
peaceably
out
and
in
this
way
she
expressed
that
she
was
pleased
and
satisfied
One
Eye
was
hungry
Though
he
lay
down
in
the
entrance
and
slept
his
sleep
was
fitful
He
kept
awaking
and
cocking
his
ears
at
the
bright
world
without
where
the
April
sun
was
blazing
across
the
snow
When
he
dozed
upon
his
ears
would
steal
the
faint
whispers
of
hidden
trickles
of
running
water
and
he
would
rouse
and
listen
intently
The
sun
had
come
back
and
all
the
awakening
Northland
world
was
calling
to
him
Life
was
stirring
The
feel
of
spring
was
in
the
air
the
feel
of
growing
life
under
the
snow
of
sap
ascending
in
the
trees
of
buds
bursting
the
shackles
of
the
frost
He
cast
anxious
glances
at
his
mate
but
she
showed
no
desire
to
get
up
He
looked
outside
and
half
a
dozen
snowbirds
fluttered
across
his
field
of
vision
He
started
to
get
up
then
looked
back
to
his
mate
again
and
settled
down
and
dozed
A
shrill
and
minute
singing
stole
upon
his
hearing
Once
and
twice
he
sleepily
brushed
his
nose
with
his
paw
Then
he
woke
up
There
buzzing
in
the
air
at
the
tip
of
his
nose
was
a
lone
mosquito
It
was
a
fullgrown
mosquito
one
that
had
lain
frozen
in
a
dry
log
all
winter
and
that
had
now
been
thawed
out
by
the
sun
He
could
resist
the
call
of
the
world
no
longer
Besides
he
was
hungry
He
crawled
over
to
his
mate
and
tried
to
persuade
her
to
get
up
But
she
only
snarled
at
him
and
he
walked
out
alone
into
the
bright
sunshine
to
find
the
snowsurface
soft
under
foot
and
the
travelling
difficult
He
went
up
the
frozen
bed
of
the
stream
where
the
snow
shaded
by
the
trees
was
yet
hard
and
crystalline
He
was
gone
eight
hours
and
he
came
back
through
the
darkness
hungrier
than
when
he
had
started
He
had
found
game
but
he
had
not
caught
it
He
had
broken
through
the
melting
snow
crust
and
wallowed
while
the
snowshoe
rabbits
had
skimmed
along
on
top
lightly
as
ever
He
paused
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
with
a
sudden
shock
of
suspicion
Faint
strange
sounds
came
from
within
They
were
sounds
not
made
by
his
mate
and
yet
they
were
remotely
familiar
He
bellied
cautiously
inside
and
was
met
by
a
warning
snarl
from
the
shewolf
This
he
received
without
perturbation
though
he
obeyed
it
by
keeping
his
distance
but
he
remained
interested
in
the
other
sounds—faint
muffled
sobbings
and
slubberings
His
mate
warned
him
irritably
away
and
he
curled
up
and
slept
in
the
entrance
When
morning
came
and
a
dim
light
pervaded
the
lair
he
again
sought
after
the
source
of
the
remotely
familiar
sounds
There
was
a
new
note
in
his
mate’s
warning
snarl
It
was
a
jealous
note
and
he
was
very
careful
in
keeping
a
respectful
distance
Nevertheless
he
made
out
sheltering
between
her
legs
against
the
length
of
her
body
five
strange
little
bundles
of
life
very
feeble
very
helpless
making
tiny
whimpering
noises
with
eyes
that
did
not
open
to
the
light
He
was
surprised
It
was
not
the
first
time
in
his
long
and
successful
life
that
this
thing
had
happened
It
had
happened
many
times
yet
each
time
it
was
as
fresh
a
surprise
as
ever
to
him
His
mate
looked
at
him
anxiously
Every
little
while
she
emitted
a
low
growl
and
at
times
when
it
seemed
to
her
he
approached
too
near
the
growl
shot
up
in
her
throat
to
a
sharp
snarl
Of
her
own
experience
she
had
no
memory
of
the
thing
happening
but
in
her
instinct
which
was
the
experience
of
all
the
mothers
of
wolves
there
lurked
a
memory
of
fathers
that
had
eaten
their
newborn
and
helpless
progeny
It
manifested
itself
as
a
fear
strong
within
her
that
made
her
prevent
One
Eye
from
more
closely
inspecting
the
cubs
he
had
fathered
But
there
was
no
danger
Old
One
Eye
was
feeling
the
urge
of
an
impulse
that
was
in
turn
an
instinct
that
had
come
down
to
him
from
all
the
fathers
of
wolves
He
did
not
question
it
nor
puzzle
over
it
It
was
there
in
the
fibre
of
his
being
and
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
that
he
should
obey
it
by
turning
his
back
on
his
newborn
family
and
by
trotting
out
and
away
on
the
meattrail
whereby
he
lived
Five
or
six
miles
from
the
lair
the
stream
divided
its
forks
going
off
among
the
mountains
at
a
right
angle
Here
leading
up
the
left
fork
he
came
upon
a
fresh
track
He
smelled
it
and
found
it
so
recent
that
he
crouched
swiftly
and
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
it
disappeared
Then
he
turned
deliberately
and
took
the
right
fork
The
footprint
was
much
larger
than
the
one
his
own
feet
made
and
he
knew
that
in
the
wake
of
such
a
trail
there
was
little
meat
for
him
Half
a
mile
up
the
right
fork
his
quick
ears
caught
the
sound
of
gnawing
teeth
He
stalked
the
quarry
and
found
it
to
be
a
porcupine
standing
upright
against
a
tree
and
trying
his
teeth
on
the
bark
One
Eye
approached
carefully
but
hopelessly
He
knew
the
breed
though
he
had
never
met
it
so
far
north
before
and
never
in
his
long
life
had
porcupine
served
him
for
a
meal
But
he
had
long
since
learned
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
Chance
or
Opportunity
and
he
continued
to
draw
near
There
was
never
any
telling
what
might
happen
for
with
live
things
events
were
somehow
always
happening
differently
The
porcupine
rolled
itself
into
a
ball
radiating
long
sharp
needles
in
all
directions
that
defied
attack
In
his
youth
One
Eye
had
once
sniffed
too
near
a
similar
apparently
inert
ball
of
quills
and
had
the
tail
flick
out
suddenly
in
his
face
One
quill
he
had
carried
away
in
his
muzzle
where
it
had
remained
for
weeks
a
rankling
flame
until
it
finally
worked
out
So
he
lay
down
in
a
comfortable
crouching
position
his
nose
fully
a
foot
away
and
out
of
the
line
of
the
tail
Thus
he
waited
keeping
perfectly
quiet
There
was
no
telling
Something
might
happen
The
porcupine
might
unroll
There
might
be
opportunity
for
a
deft
and
ripping
thrust
of
paw
into
the
tender
unguarded
belly
But
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
arose
growled
wrathfully
at
the
motionless
ball
and
trotted
on
He
had
waited
too
often
and
futilely
in
the
past
for
porcupines
to
unroll
to
waste
any
more
time
He
continued
up
the
right
fork
The
day
wore
along
and
nothing
rewarded
his
hunt
The
urge
of
his
awakened
instinct
of
fatherhood
was
strong
upon
him
He
must
find
meat
In
the
afternoon
he
blundered
upon
a
ptarmigan
He
came
out
of
a
thicket
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
slowwitted
bird
It
was
sitting
on
a
log
not
a
foot
beyond
the
end
of
his
nose
Each
saw
the
other
The
bird
made
a
startled
rise
but
he
struck
it
with
his
paw
and
smashed
it
down
to
earth
then
pounced
upon
it
and
caught
it
in
his
teeth
as
it
scuttled
across
the
snow
trying
to
rise
in
the
air
again
As
his
teeth
crunched
through
the
tender
flesh
and
fragile
bones
he
began
naturally
to
eat
Then
he
remembered
and
turning
on
the
backtrack
started
for
home
carrying
the
ptarmigan
in
his
mouth
A
mile
above
the
forks
running
velvetfooted
as
was
his
custom
a
gliding
shadow
that
cautiously
prospected
each
new
vista
of
the
trail
he
came
upon
later
imprints
of
the
large
tracks
he
had
discovered
in
the
early
morning
As
the
track
led
his
way
he
followed
prepared
to
meet
the
maker
of
it
at
every
turn
of
the
stream
He
slid
his
head
around
a
corner
of
rock
where
began
an
unusually
large
bend
in
the
stream
and
his
quick
eyes
made
out
something
that
sent
him
crouching
swiftly
down
It
was
the
maker
of
the
track
a
large
female
lynx
She
was
crouching
as
he
had
crouched
once
that
day
in
front
of
her
the
tightrolled
ball
of
quills
If
he
had
been
a
gliding
shadow
before
he
now
became
the
ghost
of
such
a
shadow
as
he
crept
and
circled
around
and
came
up
well
to
leeward
of
the
silent
motionless
pair
He
lay
down
in
the
snow
depositing
the
ptarmigan
beside
him
and
with
eyes
peering
through
the
needles
of
a
lowgrowing
spruce
he
watched
the
play
of
life
before
him—the
waiting
lynx
and
the
waiting
porcupine
each
intent
on
life
and
such
was
the
curiousness
of
the
game
the
way
of
life
for
one
lay
in
the
eating
of
the
other
and
the
way
of
life
for
the
other
lay
in
being
not
eaten
While
old
One
Eye
the
wolf
crouching
in
the
covert
played
his
part
too
in
the
game
waiting
for
some
strange
freak
of
Chance
that
might
help
him
on
the
meattrail
which
was
his
way
of
life
Half
an
hour
passed
an
hour
and
nothing
happened
The
ball
of
quills
might
have
been
a
stone
for
all
it
moved
the
lynx
might
have
been
frozen
to
marble
and
old
One
Eye
might
have
been
dead
Yet
all
three
animals
were
keyed
to
a
tenseness
of
living
that
was
almost
painful
and
scarcely
ever
would
it
come
to
them
to
be
more
alive
than
they
were
then
in
their
seeming
petrifaction
One
Eye
moved
slightly
and
peered
forth
with
increased
eagerness
Something
was
happening
The
porcupine
had
at
last
decided
that
its
enemy
had
gone
away
Slowly
cautiously
it
was
unrolling
its
ball
of
impregnable
armour
It
was
agitated
by
no
tremor
of
anticipation
Slowly
slowly
the
bristling
ball
straightened
out
and
lengthened
One
Eye
watching
felt
a
sudden
moistness
in
his
mouth
and
a
drooling
of
saliva
involuntary
excited
by
the
living
meat
that
was
spreading
itself
like
a
repast
before
him
Not
quite
entirely
had
the
porcupine
unrolled
when
it
discovered
its
enemy
In
that
instant
the
lynx
struck
The
blow
was
like
a
flash
of
light
The
paw
with
rigid
claws
curving
like
talons
shot
under
the
tender
belly
and
came
back
with
a
swift
ripping
movement
Had
the
porcupine
been
entirely
unrolled
or
had
it
not
discovered
its
enemy
a
fraction
of
a
second
before
the
blow
was
struck
the
paw
would
have
escaped
unscathed
but
a
sideflick
of
the
tail
sank
sharp
quills
into
it
as
it
was
withdrawn
Everything
had
happened
at
once—the
blow
the
counterblow
the
squeal
of
agony
from
the
porcupine
the
big
cat’s
squall
of
sudden
hurt
and
astonishment
One
Eye
half
arose
in
his
excitement
his
ears
up
his
tail
straight
out
and
quivering
behind
him
The
lynx’s
bad
temper
got
the
best
of
her
She
sprang
savagely
at
the
thing
that
had
hurt
her
But
the
porcupine
squealing
and
grunting
with
disrupted
anatomy
trying
feebly
to
roll
up
into
its
ballprotection
flicked
out
its
tail
again
and
again
the
big
cat
squalled
with
hurt
and
astonishment
Then
she
fell
to
backing
away
and
sneezing
her
nose
bristling
with
quills
like
a
monstrous
pincushion
She
brushed
her
nose
with
her
paws
trying
to
dislodge
the
fiery
darts
thrust
it
into
the
snow
and
rubbed
it
against
twigs
and
branches
and
all
the
time
leaping
about
ahead
sidewise
up
and
down
in
a
frenzy
of
pain
and
fright
She
sneezed
continually
and
her
stub
of
a
tail
was
doing
its
best
toward
lashing
about
by
giving
quick
violent
jerks
She
quit
her
antics
and
quieted
down
for
a
long
minute
One
Eye
watched
And
even
he
could
not
repress
a
start
and
an
involuntary
bristling
of
hair
along
his
back
when
she
suddenly
leaped
without
warning
straight
up
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
emitting
a
long
and
most
terrible
squall
Then
she
sprang
away
up
the
trail
squalling
with
every
leap
she
made
It
was
not
until
her
racket
had
faded
away
in
the
distance
and
died
out
that
One
Eye
ventured
forth
He
walked
as
delicately
as
though
all
the
snow
were
carpeted
with
porcupine
quills
erect
and
ready
to
pierce
the
soft
pads
of
his
feet
The
porcupine
met
his
approach
with
a
furious
squealing
and
a
clashing
of
its
long
teeth
It
had
managed
to
roll
up
in
a
ball
again
but
it
was
not
quite
the
old
compact
ball
its
muscles
were
too
much
torn
for
that
It
had
been
ripped
almost
in
half
and
was
still
bleeding
profusely
One
Eye
scooped
out
mouthfuls
of
the
bloodsoaked
snow
and
chewed
and
tasted
and
swallowed
This
served
as
a
relish
and
his
hunger
increased
mightily
but
he
was
too
old
in
the
world
to
forget
his
caution
He
waited
He
lay
down
and
waited
while
the
porcupine
grated
its
teeth
and
uttered
grunts
and
sobs
and
occasional
sharp
little
squeals
In
a
little
while
One
Eye
noticed
that
the
quills
were
drooping
and
that
a
great
quivering
had
set
up
The
quivering
came
to
an
end
suddenly
There
was
a
final
defiant
clash
of
the
long
teeth
Then
all
the
quills
drooped
quite
down
and
the
body
relaxed
and
moved
no
more
With
a
nervous
shrinking
paw
One
Eye
stretched
out
the
porcupine
to
its
full
length
and
turned
it
over
on
its
back
Nothing
had
happened
It
was
surely
dead
He
studied
it
intently
for
a
moment
then
took
a
careful
grip
with
his
teeth
and
started
off
down
the
stream
partly
carrying
partly
dragging
the
porcupine
with
head
turned
to
the
side
so
as
to
avoid
stepping
on
the
prickly
mass
He
recollected
something
dropped
the
burden
and
trotted
back
to
where
he
had
left
the
ptarmigan
He
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
He
knew
clearly
what
was
to
be
done
and
this
he
did
by
promptly
eating
the
ptarmigan
Then
he
returned
and
took
up
his
burden
When
he
dragged
the
result
of
his
day’s
hunt
into
the
cave
the
shewolf
inspected
it
turned
her
muzzle
to
him
and
lightly
licked
him
on
the
neck
But
the
next
instant
she
was
warning
him
away
from
the
cubs
with
a
snarl
that
was
less
harsh
than
usual
and
that
was
more
apologetic
than
menacing
Her
instinctive
fear
of
the
father
of
her
progeny
was
toning
down
He
was
behaving
as
a
wolffather
should
and
manifesting
no
unholy
desire
to
devour
the
young
lives
she
had
brought
into
the
world
CHAPTER
III
THE
GREY
CUB
He
was
different
from
his
brothers
and
sisters
Their
hair
already
betrayed
the
reddish
hue
inherited
from
their
mother
the
shewolf
while
he
alone
in
this
particular
took
after
his
father
He
was
the
one
little
grey
cub
of
the
litter
He
had
bred
true
to
the
straight
wolfstock—in
fact
he
had
bred
true
to
old
One
Eye
himself
physically
with
but
a
single
exception
and
that
was
he
had
two
eyes
to
his
father’s
one
The
grey
cub’s
eyes
had
not
been
open
long
yet
already
he
could
see
with
steady
clearness
And
while
his
eyes
were
still
closed
he
had
felt
tasted
and
smelled
He
knew
his
two
brothers
and
his
two
sisters
very
well
He
had
begun
to
romp
with
them
in
a
feeble
awkward
way
and
even
to
squabble
his
little
throat
vibrating
with
a
queer
rasping
noise
the
forerunner
of
the
growl
as
he
worked
himself
into
a
passion
And
long
before
his
eyes
had
opened
he
had
learned
by
touch
taste
and
smell
to
know
his
mother—a
fount
of
warmth
and
liquid
food
and
tenderness
She
possessed
a
gentle
caressing
tongue
that
soothed
him
when
it
passed
over
his
soft
little
body
and
that
impelled
him
to
snuggle
close
against
her
and
to
doze
off
to
sleep
Most
of
the
first
month
of
his
life
had
been
passed
thus
in
sleeping
but
now
he
could
see
quite
well
and
he
stayed
awake
for
longer
periods
of
time
and
he
was
coming
to
learn
his
world
quite
well
His
world
was
gloomy
but
he
did
not
know
that
for
he
knew
no
other
world
It
was
dimlighted
but
his
eyes
had
never
had
to
adjust
themselves
to
any
other
light
His
world
was
very
small
Its
limits
were
the
walls
of
the
lair
but
as
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
wide
world
outside
he
was
never
oppressed
by
the
narrow
confines
of
his
existence
But
he
had
early
discovered
that
one
wall
of
his
world
was
different
from
the
rest
This
was
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
the
source
of
light
He
had
discovered
that
it
was
different
from
the
other
walls
long
before
he
had
any
thoughts
of
his
own
any
conscious
volitions
It
had
been
an
irresistible
attraction
before
ever
his
eyes
opened
and
looked
upon
it
The
light
from
it
had
beat
upon
his
sealed
lids
and
the
eyes
and
the
optic
nerves
had
pulsated
to
little
sparklike
flashes
warmcoloured
and
strangely
pleasing
The
life
of
his
body
and
of
every
fibre
of
his
body
the
life
that
was
the
very
substance
of
his
body
and
that
was
apart
from
his
own
personal
life
had
yearned
toward
this
light
and
urged
his
body
toward
it
in
the
same
way
that
the
cunning
chemistry
of
a
plant
urges
it
toward
the
sun
Always
in
the
beginning
before
his
conscious
life
dawned
he
had
crawled
toward
the
mouth
of
the
cave
And
in
this
his
brothers
and
sisters
were
one
with
him
Never
in
that
period
did
any
of
them
crawl
toward
the
dark
corners
of
the
backwall
The
light
drew
them
as
if
they
were
plants
the
chemistry
of
the
life
that
composed
them
demanded
the
light
as
a
necessity
of
being
and
their
little
puppetbodies
crawled
blindly
and
chemically
like
the
tendrils
of
a
vine
Later
on
when
each
developed
individuality
and
became
personally
conscious
of
impulsions
and
desires
the
attraction
of
the
light
increased
They
were
always
crawling
and
sprawling
toward
it
and
being
driven
back
from
it
by
their
mother
It
was
in
this
way
that
the
grey
cub
learned
other
attributes
of
his
mother
than
the
soft
soothing
tongue
In
his
insistent
crawling
toward
the
light
he
discovered
in
her
a
nose
that
with
a
sharp
nudge
administered
rebuke
and
later
a
paw
that
crushed
him
down
and
rolled
him
over
and
over
with
swift
calculating
stroke
Thus
he
learned
hurt
and
on
top
of
it
he
learned
to
avoid
hurt
first
by
not
incurring
the
risk
of
it
and
second
when
he
had
incurred
the
risk
by
dodging
and
by
retreating
These
were
conscious
actions
and
were
the
results
of
his
first
generalisations
upon
the
world
Before
that
he
had
recoiled
automatically
from
hurt
as
he
had
crawled
automatically
toward
the
light
After
that
he
recoiled
from
hurt
because
he
knew
that
it
was
hurt
He
was
a
fierce
little
cub
So
were
his
brothers
and
sisters
It
was
to
be
expected
He
was
a
carnivorous
animal
He
came
of
a
breed
of
meatkillers
and
meateaters
His
father
and
mother
lived
wholly
upon
meat
The
milk
he
had
sucked
with
his
first
flickering
life
was
milk
transformed
directly
from
meat
and
now
at
a
month
old
when
his
eyes
had
been
open
for
but
a
week
he
was
beginning
himself
to
eat
meat—meat
halfdigested
by
the
shewolf
and
disgorged
for
the
five
growing
cubs
that
already
made
too
great
demand
upon
her
breast
But
he
was
further
the
fiercest
of
the
litter
He
could
make
a
louder
rasping
growl
than
any
of
them
His
tiny
rages
were
much
more
terrible
than
theirs
It
was
he
that
first
learned
the
trick
of
rolling
a
fellowcub
over
with
a
cunning
pawstroke
And
it
was
he
that
first
gripped
another
cub
by
the
ear
and
pulled
and
tugged
and
growled
through
jaws
tightclenched
And
certainly
it
was
he
that
caused
the
mother
the
most
trouble
in
keeping
her
litter
from
the
mouth
of
the
cave
The
fascination
of
the
light
for
the
grey
cub
increased
from
day
to
day
He
was
perpetually
departing
on
yardlong
adventures
toward
the
cave’s
entrance
and
as
perpetually
being
driven
back
Only
he
did
not
know
it
for
an
entrance
He
did
not
know
anything
about
entrances—passages
whereby
one
goes
from
one
place
to
another
place
He
did
not
know
any
other
place
much
less
of
a
way
to
get
there
So
to
him
the
entrance
of
the
cave
was
a
wall—a
wall
of
light
As
the
sun
was
to
the
outside
dweller
this
wall
was
to
him
the
sun
of
his
world
It
attracted
him
as
a
candle
attracts
a
moth
He
was
always
striving
to
attain
it
The
life
that
was
so
swiftly
expanding
within
him
urged
him
continually
toward
the
wall
of
light
The
life
that
was
within
him
knew
that
it
was
the
one
way
out
the
way
he
was
predestined
to
tread
But
he
himself
did
not
know
anything
about
it
He
did
not
know
there
was
any
outside
at
all
There
was
one
strange
thing
about
this
wall
of
light
His
father
he
had
already
come
to
recognise
his
father
as
the
one
other
dweller
in
the
world
a
creature
like
his
mother
who
slept
near
the
light
and
was
a
bringer
of
meat—his
father
had
a
way
of
walking
right
into
the
white
far
wall
and
disappearing
The
grey
cub
could
not
understand
this
Though
never
permitted
by
his
mother
to
approach
that
wall
he
had
approached
the
other
walls
and
encountered
hard
obstruction
on
the
end
of
his
tender
nose
This
hurt
And
after
several
such
adventures
he
left
the
walls
alone
Without
thinking
about
it
he
accepted
this
disappearing
into
the
wall
as
a
peculiarity
of
his
father
as
milk
and
halfdigested
meat
were
peculiarities
of
his
mother
In
fact
the
grey
cub
was
not
given
to
thinking—at
least
to
the
kind
of
thinking
customary
of
men
His
brain
worked
in
dim
ways
Yet
his
conclusions
were
as
sharp
and
distinct
as
those
achieved
by
men
He
had
a
method
of
accepting
things
without
questioning
the
why
and
wherefore
In
reality
this
was
the
act
of
classification
He
was
never
disturbed
over
why
a
thing
happened
How
it
happened
was
sufficient
for
him
Thus
when
he
had
bumped
his
nose
on
the
backwall
a
few
times
he
accepted
that
he
would
not
disappear
into
walls
In
the
same
way
he
accepted
that
his
father
could
disappear
into
walls
But
he
was
not
in
the
least
disturbed
by
desire
to
find
out
the
reason
for
the
difference
between
his
father
and
himself
Logic
and
physics
were
no
part
of
his
mental
makeup
Like
most
creatures
of
the
Wild
he
early
experienced
famine
There
came
a
time
when
not
only
did
the
meatsupply
cease
but
the
milk
no
longer
came
from
his
mother’s
breast
At
first
the
cubs
whimpered
and
cried
but
for
the
most
part
they
slept
It
was
not
long
before
they
were
reduced
to
a
coma
of
hunger
There
were
no
more
spats
and
squabbles
no
more
tiny
rages
nor
attempts
at
growling
while
the
adventures
toward
the
far
white
wall
ceased
altogether
The
cubs
slept
while
the
life
that
was
in
them
flickered
and
died
down
One
Eye
was
desperate
He
ranged
far
and
wide
and
slept
but
little
in
the
lair
that
had
now
become
cheerless
and
miserable
The
shewolf
too
left
her
litter
and
went
out
in
search
of
meat
In
the
first
days
after
the
birth
of
the
cubs
One
Eye
had
journeyed
several
times
back
to
the
Indian
camp
and
robbed
the
rabbit
snares
but
with
the
melting
of
the
snow
and
the
opening
of
the
streams
the
Indian
camp
had
moved
away
and
that
source
of
supply
was
closed
to
him
When
the
grey
cub
came
back
to
life
and
again
took
interest
in
the
far
white
wall
he
found
that
the
population
of
his
world
had
been
reduced
Only
one
sister
remained
to
him
The
rest
were
gone
As
he
grew
stronger
he
found
himself
compelled
to
play
alone
for
the
sister
no
longer
lifted
her
head
nor
moved
about
His
little
body
rounded
out
with
the
meat
he
now
ate
but
the
food
had
come
too
late
for
her
She
slept
continuously
a
tiny
skeleton
flung
round
with
skin
in
which
the
flame
flickered
lower
and
lower
and
at
last
went
out
Then
there
came
a
time
when
the
grey
cub
no
longer
saw
his
father
appearing
and
disappearing
in
the
wall
nor
lying
down
asleep
in
the
entrance
This
had
happened
at
the
end
of
a
second
and
less
severe
famine
The
shewolf
knew
why
One
Eye
never
came
back
but
there
was
no
way
by
which
she
could
tell
what
she
had
seen
to
the
grey
cub
Hunting
herself
for
meat
up
the
left
fork
of
the
stream
where
lived
the
lynx
she
had
followed
a
dayold
trail
of
One
Eye
And
she
had
found
him
or
what
remained
of
him
at
the
end
of
the
trail
There
were
many
signs
of
the
battle
that
had
been
fought
and
of
the
lynx’s
withdrawal
to
her
lair
after
having
won
the
victory
Before
she
went
away
the
shewolf
had
found
this
lair
but
the
signs
told
her
that
the
lynx
was
inside
and
she
had
not
dared
to
venture
in
After
that
the
shewolf
in
her
hunting
avoided
the
left
fork
For
she
knew
that
in
the
lynx’s
lair
was
a
litter
of
kittens
and
she
knew
the
lynx
for
a
fierce
badtempered
creature
and
a
terrible
fighter
It
was
all
very
well
for
half
a
dozen
wolves
to
drive
a
lynx
spitting
and
bristling
up
a
tree
but
it
was
quite
a
different
matter
for
a
lone
wolf
to
encounter
a
lynx—especially
when
the
lynx
was
known
to
have
a
litter
of
hungry
kittens
at
her
back
But
the
Wild
is
the
Wild
and
motherhood
is
motherhood
at
all
times
fiercely
protective
whether
in
the
Wild
or
out
of
it
and
the
time
was
to
come
when
the
shewolf
for
her
grey
cub’s
sake
would
venture
the
left
fork
and
the
lair
in
the
rocks
and
the
lynx’s
wrath
CHAPTER
IV
THE
WALL
OF
THE
WORLD
By
the
time
his
mother
began
leaving
the
cave
on
hunting
expeditions
the
cub
had
learned
well
the
law
that
forbade
his
approaching
the
entrance
Not
only
had
this
law
been
forcibly
and
many
times
impressed
on
him
by
his
mother’s
nose
and
paw
but
in
him
the
instinct
of
fear
was
developing
Never
in
his
brief
cavelife
had
he
encountered
anything
of
which
to
be
afraid
Yet
fear
was
in
him
It
had
come
down
to
him
from
a
remote
ancestry
through
a
thousand
thousand
lives
It
was
a
heritage
he
had
received
directly
from
One
Eye
and
the
shewolf
but
to
them
in
turn
it
had
been
passed
down
through
all
the
generations
of
wolves
that
had
gone
before
Fear—that
legacy
of
the
Wild
which
no
animal
may
escape
nor
exchange
for
pottage
So
the
grey
cub
knew
fear
though
he
knew
not
the
stuff
of
which
fear
was
made
Possibly
he
accepted
it
as
one
of
the
restrictions
of
life
For
he
had
already
learned
that
there
were
such
restrictions
Hunger
he
had
known
and
when
he
could
not
appease
his
hunger
he
had
felt
restriction
The
hard
obstruction
of
the
cavewall
the
sharp
nudge
of
his
mother’s
nose
the
smashing
stroke
of
her
paw
the
hunger
unappeased
of
several
famines
had
borne
in
upon
him
that
all
was
not
freedom
in
the
world
that
to
life
there
was
limitations
and
restraints
These
limitations
and
restraints
were
laws
To
be
obedient
to
them
was
to
escape
hurt
and
make
for
happiness
He
did
not
reason
the
question
out
in
this
man
fashion
He
merely
classified
the
things
that
hurt
and
the
things
that
did
not
hurt
And
after
such
classification
he
avoided
the
things
that
hurt
the
restrictions
and
restraints
in
order
to
enjoy
the
satisfactions
and
the
remunerations
of
life
Thus
it
was
that
in
obedience
to
the
law
laid
down
by
his
mother
and
in
obedience
to
the
law
of
that
unknown
and
nameless
thing
fear
he
kept
away
from
the
mouth
of
the
cave
It
remained
to
him
a
white
wall
of
light
When
his
mother
was
absent
he
slept
most
of
the
time
while
during
the
intervals
that
he
was
awake
he
kept
very
quiet
suppressing
the
whimpering
cries
that
tickled
in
his
throat
and
strove
for
noise
Once
lying
awake
he
heard
a
strange
sound
in
the
white
wall
He
did
not
know
that
it
was
a
wolverine
standing
outside
all
atrembling
with
its
own
daring
and
cautiously
scenting
out
the
contents
of
the
cave
The
cub
knew
only
that
the
sniff
was
strange
a
something
unclassified
therefore
unknown
and
terrible—for
the
unknown
was
one
of
the
chief
elements
that
went
into
the
making
of
fear
The
hair
bristled
upon
the
grey
cub’s
back
but
it
bristled
silently
How
was
he
to
know
that
this
thing
that
sniffed
was
a
thing
at
which
to
bristle
It
was
not
born
of
any
knowledge
of
his
yet
it
was
the
visible
expression
of
the
fear
that
was
in
him
and
for
which
in
his
own
life
there
was
no
accounting
But
fear
was
accompanied
by
another
instinct—that
of
concealment
The
cub
was
in
a
frenzy
of
terror
yet
he
lay
without
movement
or
sound
frozen
petrified
into
immobility
to
all
appearances
dead
His
mother
coming
home
growled
as
she
smelt
the
wolverine’s
track
and
bounded
into
the
cave
and
licked
and
nozzled
him
with
undue
vehemence
of
affection
And
the
cub
felt
that
somehow
he
had
escaped
a
great
hurt
But
there
were
other
forces
at
work
in
the
cub
the
greatest
of
which
was
growth
Instinct
and
law
demanded
of
him
obedience
But
growth
demanded
disobedience
His
mother
and
fear
impelled
him
to
keep
away
from
the
white
wall
Growth
is
life
and
life
is
for
ever
destined
to
make
for
light
So
there
was
no
damming
up
the
tide
of
life
that
was
rising
within
him—rising
with
every
mouthful
of
meat
he
swallowed
with
every
breath
he
drew
In
the
end
one
day
fear
and
obedience
were
swept
away
by
the
rush
of
life
and
the
cub
straddled
and
sprawled
toward
the
entrance
Unlike
any
other
wall
with
which
he
had
had
experience
this
wall
seemed
to
recede
from
him
as
he
approached
No
hard
surface
collided
with
the
tender
little
nose
he
thrust
out
tentatively
before
him
The
substance
of
the
wall
seemed
as
permeable
and
yielding
as
light
And
as
condition
in
his
eyes
had
the
seeming
of
form
so
he
entered
into
what
had
been
wall
to
him
and
bathed
in
the
substance
that
composed
it
It
was
bewildering
He
was
sprawling
through
solidity
And
ever
the
light
grew
brighter
Fear
urged
him
to
go
back
but
growth
drove
him
on
Suddenly
he
found
himself
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
The
wall
inside
which
he
had
thought
himself
as
suddenly
leaped
back
before
him
to
an
immeasurable
distance
The
light
had
become
painfully
bright
He
was
dazzled
by
it
Likewise
he
was
made
dizzy
by
this
abrupt
and
tremendous
extension
of
space
Automatically
his
eyes
were
adjusting
themselves
to
the
brightness
focusing
themselves
to
meet
the
increased
distance
of
objects
At
first
the
wall
had
leaped
beyond
his
vision
He
now
saw
it
again
but
it
had
taken
upon
itself
a
remarkable
remoteness
Also
its
appearance
had
changed
It
was
now
a
variegated
wall
composed
of
the
trees
that
fringed
the
stream
the
opposing
mountain
that
towered
above
the
trees
and
the
sky
that
outtowered
the
mountain
A
great
fear
came
upon
him
This
was
more
of
the
terrible
unknown
He
crouched
down
on
the
lip
of
the
cave
and
gazed
out
on
the
world
He
was
very
much
afraid
Because
it
was
unknown
it
was
hostile
to
him
Therefore
the
hair
stood
up
on
end
along
his
back
and
his
lips
wrinkled
weakly
in
an
attempt
at
a
ferocious
and
intimidating
snarl
Out
of
his
puniness
and
fright
he
challenged
and
menaced
the
whole
wide
world
Nothing
happened
He
continued
to
gaze
and
in
his
interest
he
forgot
to
snarl
Also
he
forgot
to
be
afraid
For
the
time
fear
had
been
routed
by
growth
while
growth
had
assumed
the
guise
of
curiosity
He
began
to
notice
near
objects—an
open
portion
of
the
stream
that
flashed
in
the
sun
the
blasted
pinetree
that
stood
at
the
base
of
the
slope
and
the
slope
itself
that
ran
right
up
to
him
and
ceased
two
feet
beneath
the
lip
of
the
cave
on
which
he
crouched
Now
the
grey
cub
had
lived
all
his
days
on
a
level
floor
He
had
never
experienced
the
hurt
of
a
fall
He
did
not
know
what
a
fall
was
So
he
stepped
boldly
out
upon
the
air
His
hindlegs
still
rested
on
the
cavelip
so
he
fell
forward
head
downward
The
earth
struck
him
a
harsh
blow
on
the
nose
that
made
him
yelp
Then
he
began
rolling
down
the
slope
over
and
over
He
was
in
a
panic
of
terror
The
unknown
had
caught
him
at
last
It
had
gripped
savagely
hold
of
him
and
was
about
to
wreak
upon
him
some
terrific
hurt
Growth
was
now
routed
by
fear
and
he
kiyi’d
like
any
frightened
puppy
The
unknown
bore
him
on
he
knew
not
to
what
frightful
hurt
and
he
yelped
and
kiyi’d
unceasingly
This
was
a
different
proposition
from
crouching
in
frozen
fear
while
the
unknown
lurked
just
alongside
Now
the
unknown
had
caught
tight
hold
of
him
Silence
would
do
no
good
Besides
it
was
not
fear
but
terror
that
convulsed
him
But
the
slope
grew
more
gradual
and
its
base
was
grasscovered
Here
the
cub
lost
momentum
When
at
last
he
came
to
a
stop
he
gave
one
last
agonised
yell
and
then
a
long
whimpering
wail
Also
and
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
as
though
in
his
life
he
had
already
made
a
thousand
toilets
he
proceeded
to
lick
away
the
dry
clay
that
soiled
him
After
that
he
sat
up
and
gazed
about
him
as
might
the
first
man
of
the
earth
who
landed
upon
Mars
The
cub
had
broken
through
the
wall
of
the
world
the
unknown
had
let
go
its
hold
of
him
and
here
he
was
without
hurt
But
the
first
man
on
Mars
would
have
experienced
less
unfamiliarity
than
did
he
Without
any
antecedent
knowledge
without
any
warning
whatever
that
such
existed
he
found
himself
an
explorer
in
a
totally
new
world
Now
that
the
terrible
unknown
had
let
go
of
him
he
forgot
that
the
unknown
had
any
terrors
He
was
aware
only
of
curiosity
in
all
the
things
about
him
He
inspected
the
grass
beneath
him
the
mossberry
plant
just
beyond
and
the
dead
trunk
of
the
blasted
pine
that
stood
on
the
edge
of
an
open
space
among
the
trees
A
squirrel
running
around
the
base
of
the
trunk
came
full
upon
him
and
gave
him
a
great
fright
He
cowered
down
and
snarled
But
the
squirrel
was
as
badly
scared
It
ran
up
the
tree
and
from
a
point
of
safety
chattered
back
savagely
This
helped
the
cub’s
courage
and
though
the
woodpecker
he
next
encountered
gave
him
a
start
he
proceeded
confidently
on
his
way
Such
was
his
confidence
that
when
a
moosebird
impudently
hopped
up
to
him
he
reached
out
at
it
with
a
playful
paw
The
result
was
a
sharp
peck
on
the
end
of
his
nose
that
made
him
cower
down
and
kiyi
The
noise
he
made
was
too
much
for
the
moosebird
who
sought
safety
in
flight
But
the
cub
was
learning
His
misty
little
mind
had
already
made
an
unconscious
classification
There
were
live
things
and
things
not
alive
Also
he
must
watch
out
for
the
live
things
The
things
not
alive
remained
always
in
one
place
but
the
live
things
moved
about
and
there
was
no
telling
what
they
might
do
The
thing
to
expect
of
them
was
the
unexpected
and
for
this
he
must
be
prepared
He
travelled
very
clumsily
He
ran
into
sticks
and
things
A
twig
that
he
thought
a
long
way
off
would
the
next
instant
hit
him
on
the
nose
or
rake
along
his
ribs
There
were
inequalities
of
surface
Sometimes
he
overstepped
and
stubbed
his
nose
Quite
as
often
he
understepped
and
stubbed
his
feet
Then
there
were
the
pebbles
and
stones
that
turned
under
him
when
he
trod
upon
them
and
from
them
he
came
to
know
that
the
things
not
alive
were
not
all
in
the
same
state
of
stable
equilibrium
as
was
his
cave—also
that
small
things
not
alive
were
more
liable
than
large
things
to
fall
down
or
turn
over
But
with
every
mishap
he
was
learning
The
longer
he
walked
the
better
he
walked
He
was
adjusting
himself
He
was
learning
to
calculate
his
own
muscular
movements
to
know
his
physical
limitations
to
measure
distances
between
objects
and
between
objects
and
himself
His
was
the
luck
of
the
beginner
Born
to
be
a
hunter
of
meat
though
he
did
not
know
it
he
blundered
upon
meat
just
outside
his
own
cavedoor
on
his
first
foray
into
the
world
It
was
by
sheer
blundering
that
he
chanced
upon
the
shrewdly
hidden
ptarmigan
nest
He
fell
into
it
He
had
essayed
to
walk
along
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
pine
The
rotten
bark
gave
way
under
his
feet
and
with
a
despairing
yelp
he
pitched
down
the
rounded
crescent
smashed
through
the
leafage
and
stalks
of
a
small
bush
and
in
the
heart
of
the
bush
on
the
ground
fetched
up
in
the
midst
of
seven
ptarmigan
chicks
They
made
noises
and
at
first
he
was
frightened
at
them
Then
he
perceived
that
they
were
very
little
and
he
became
bolder
They
moved
He
placed
his
paw
on
one
and
its
movements
were
accelerated
This
was
a
source
of
enjoyment
to
him
He
smelled
it
He
picked
it
up
in
his
mouth
It
struggled
and
tickled
his
tongue
At
the
same
time
he
was
made
aware
of
a
sensation
of
hunger
His
jaws
closed
together
There
was
a
crunching
of
fragile
bones
and
warm
blood
ran
in
his
mouth
The
taste
of
it
was
good
This
was
meat
the
same
as
his
mother
gave
him
only
it
was
alive
between
his
teeth
and
therefore
better
So
he
ate
the
ptarmigan
Nor
did
he
stop
till
he
had
devoured
the
whole
brood
Then
he
licked
his
chops
in
quite
the
same
way
his
mother
did
and
began
to
crawl
out
of
the
bush
He
encountered
a
feathered
whirlwind
He
was
confused
and
blinded
by
the
rush
of
it
and
the
beat
of
angry
wings
He
hid
his
head
between
his
paws
and
yelped
The
blows
increased
The
mother
ptarmigan
was
in
a
fury
Then
he
became
angry
He
rose
up
snarling
striking
out
with
his
paws
He
sank
his
tiny
teeth
into
one
of
the
wings
and
pulled
and
tugged
sturdily
The
ptarmigan
struggled
against
him
showering
blows
upon
him
with
her
free
wing
It
was
his
first
battle
He
was
elated
He
forgot
all
about
the
unknown
He
no
longer
was
afraid
of
anything
He
was
fighting
tearing
at
a
live
thing
that
was
striking
at
him
Also
this
live
thing
was
meat
The
lust
to
kill
was
on
him
He
had
just
destroyed
little
live
things
He
would
now
destroy
a
big
live
thing
He
was
too
busy
and
happy
to
know
that
he
was
happy
He
was
thrilling
and
exulting
in
ways
new
to
him
and
greater
to
him
than
any
he
had
known
before
He
held
on
to
the
wing
and
growled
between
his
tightclenched
teeth
The
ptarmigan
dragged
him
out
of
the
bush
When
she
turned
and
tried
to
drag
him
back
into
the
bush’s
shelter
he
pulled
her
away
from
it
and
on
into
the
open
And
all
the
time
she
was
making
outcry
and
striking
with
her
free
wing
while
feathers
were
flying
like
a
snowfall
The
pitch
to
which
he
was
aroused
was
tremendous
All
the
fighting
blood
of
his
breed
was
up
in
him
and
surging
through
him
This
was
living
though
he
did
not
know
it
He
was
realising
his
own
meaning
in
the
world
he
was
doing
that
for
which
he
was
made—killing
meat
and
battling
to
kill
it
He
was
justifying
his
existence
than
which
life
can
do
no
greater
for
life
achieves
its
summit
when
it
does
to
the
uttermost
that
which
it
was
equipped
to
do
After
a
time
the
ptarmigan
ceased
her
struggling
He
still
held
her
by
the
wing
and
they
lay
on
the
ground
and
looked
at
each
other
He
tried
to
growl
threateningly
ferociously
She
pecked
on
his
nose
which
by
now
what
of
previous
adventures
was
sore
He
winced
but
held
on
She
pecked
him
again
and
again
From
wincing
he
went
to
whimpering
He
tried
to
back
away
from
her
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
by
his
hold
on
her
he
dragged
her
after
him
A
rain
of
pecks
fell
on
his
illused
nose
The
flood
of
fight
ebbed
down
in
him
and
releasing
his
prey
he
turned
tail
and
scampered
on
across
the
open
in
inglorious
retreat
He
lay
down
to
rest
on
the
other
side
of
the
open
near
the
edge
of
the
bushes
his
tongue
lolling
out
his
chest
heaving
and
panting
his
nose
still
hurting
him
and
causing
him
to
continue
his
whimper
But
as
he
lay
there
suddenly
there
came
to
him
a
feeling
as
of
something
terrible
impending
The
unknown
with
all
its
terrors
rushed
upon
him
and
he
shrank
back
instinctively
into
the
shelter
of
the
bush
As
he
did
so
a
draught
of
air
fanned
him
and
a
large
winged
body
swept
ominously
and
silently
past
A
hawk
driving
down
out
of
the
blue
had
barely
missed
him
While
he
lay
in
the
bush
recovering
from
his
fright
and
peering
fearfully
out
the
motherptarmigan
on
the
other
side
of
the
open
space
fluttered
out
of
the
ravaged
nest
It
was
because
of
her
loss
that
she
paid
no
attention
to
the
winged
bolt
of
the
sky
But
the
cub
saw
and
it
was
a
warning
and
a
lesson
to
him—the
swift
downward
swoop
of
the
hawk
the
short
skim
of
its
body
just
above
the
ground
the
strike
of
its
talons
in
the
body
of
the
ptarmigan
the
ptarmigan’s
squawk
of
agony
and
fright
and
the
hawk’s
rush
upward
into
the
blue
carrying
the
ptarmigan
away
with
it
It
was
a
long
time
before
the
cub
left
its
shelter
He
had
learned
much
Live
things
were
meat
They
were
good
to
eat
Also
live
things
when
they
were
large
enough
could
give
hurt
It
was
better
to
eat
small
live
things
like
ptarmigan
chicks
and
to
let
alone
large
live
things
like
ptarmigan
hens
Nevertheless
he
felt
a
little
prick
of
ambition
a
sneaking
desire
to
have
another
battle
with
that
ptarmigan
hen—only
the
hawk
had
carried
her
away
May
be
there
were
other
ptarmigan
hens
He
would
go
and
see
He
came
down
a
shelving
bank
to
the
stream
He
had
never
seen
water
before
The
footing
looked
good
There
were
no
inequalities
of
surface
He
stepped
boldly
out
on
it
and
went
down
crying
with
fear
into
the
embrace
of
the
unknown
It
was
cold
and
he
gasped
breathing
quickly
The
water
rushed
into
his
lungs
instead
of
the
air
that
had
always
accompanied
his
act
of
breathing
The
suffocation
he
experienced
was
like
the
pang
of
death
To
him
it
signified
death
He
had
no
conscious
knowledge
of
death
but
like
every
animal
of
the
Wild
he
possessed
the
instinct
of
death
To
him
it
stood
as
the
greatest
of
hurts
It
was
the
very
essence
of
the
unknown
it
was
the
sum
of
the
terrors
of
the
unknown
the
one
culminating
and
unthinkable
catastrophe
that
could
happen
to
him
about
which
he
knew
nothing
and
about
which
he
feared
everything
He
came
to
the
surface
and
the
sweet
air
rushed
into
his
open
mouth
He
did
not
go
down
again
Quite
as
though
it
had
been
a
longestablished
custom
of
his
he
struck
out
with
all
his
legs
and
began
to
swim
The
near
bank
was
a
yard
away
but
he
had
come
up
with
his
back
to
it
and
the
first
thing
his
eyes
rested
upon
was
the
opposite
bank
toward
which
he
immediately
began
to
swim
The
stream
was
a
small
one
but
in
the
pool
it
widened
out
to
a
score
of
feet
Midway
in
the
passage
the
current
picked
up
the
cub
and
swept
him
downstream
He
was
caught
in
the
miniature
rapid
at
the
bottom
of
the
pool
Here
was
little
chance
for
swimming
The
quiet
water
had
become
suddenly
angry
Sometimes
he
was
under
sometimes
on
top
At
all
times
he
was
in
violent
motion
now
being
turned
over
or
around
and
again
being
smashed
against
a
rock
And
with
every
rock
he
struck
he
yelped
His
progress
was
a
series
of
yelps
from
which
might
have
been
adduced
the
number
of
rocks
he
encountered
Below
the
rapid
was
a
second
pool
and
here
captured
by
the
eddy
he
was
gently
borne
to
the
bank
and
as
gently
deposited
on
a
bed
of
gravel
He
crawled
frantically
clear
of
the
water
and
lay
down
He
had
learned
some
more
about
the
world
Water
was
not
alive
Yet
it
moved
Also
it
looked
as
solid
as
the
earth
but
was
without
any
solidity
at
all
His
conclusion
was
that
things
were
not
always
what
they
appeared
to
be
The
cub’s
fear
of
the
unknown
was
an
inherited
distrust
and
it
had
now
been
strengthened
by
experience
Thenceforth
in
the
nature
of
things
he
would
possess
an
abiding
distrust
of
appearances
He
would
have
to
learn
the
reality
of
a
thing
before
he
could
put
his
faith
into
it
One
other
adventure
was
destined
for
him
that
day
He
had
recollected
that
there
was
such
a
thing
in
the
world
as
his
mother
And
then
there
came
to
him
a
feeling
that
he
wanted
her
more
than
all
the
rest
of
the
things
in
the
world
Not
only
was
his
body
tired
with
the
adventures
it
had
undergone
but
his
little
brain
was
equally
tired
In
all
the
days
he
had
lived
it
had
not
worked
so
hard
as
on
this
one
day
Furthermore
he
was
sleepy
So
he
started
out
to
look
for
the
cave
and
his
mother
feeling
at
the
same
time
an
overwhelming
rush
of
loneliness
and
helplessness
He
was
sprawling
along
between
some
bushes
when
he
heard
a
sharp
intimidating
cry
There
was
a
flash
of
yellow
before
his
eyes
He
saw
a
weasel
leaping
swiftly
away
from
him
It
was
a
small
live
thing
and
he
had
no
fear
Then
before
him
at
his
feet
he
saw
an
extremely
small
live
thing
only
several
inches
long
a
young
weasel
that
like
himself
had
disobediently
gone
out
adventuring
It
tried
to
retreat
before
him
He
turned
it
over
with
his
paw
It
made
a
queer
grating
noise
The
next
moment
the
flash
of
yellow
reappeared
before
his
eyes
He
heard
again
the
intimidating
cry
and
at
the
same
instant
received
a
sharp
blow
on
the
side
of
the
neck
and
felt
the
sharp
teeth
of
the
motherweasel
cut
into
his
flesh
While
he
yelped
and
kiyi’d
and
scrambled
backward
he
saw
the
motherweasel
leap
upon
her
young
one
and
disappear
with
it
into
the
neighbouring
thicket
The
cut
of
her
teeth
in
his
neck
still
hurt
but
his
feelings
were
hurt
more
grievously
and
he
sat
down
and
weakly
whimpered
This
motherweasel
was
so
small
and
so
savage
He
was
yet
to
learn
that
for
size
and
weight
the
weasel
was
the
most
ferocious
vindictive
and
terrible
of
all
the
killers
of
the
Wild
But
a
portion
of
this
knowledge
was
quickly
to
be
his
He
was
still
whimpering
when
the
motherweasel
reappeared
She
did
not
rush
him
now
that
her
young
one
was
safe
She
approached
more
cautiously
and
the
cub
had
full
opportunity
to
observe
her
lean
snakelike
body
and
her
head
erect
eager
and
snakelike
itself
Her
sharp
menacing
cry
sent
the
hair
bristling
along
his
back
and
he
snarled
warningly
at
her
She
came
closer
and
closer
There
was
a
leap
swifter
than
his
unpractised
sight
and
the
lean
yellow
body
disappeared
for
a
moment
out
of
the
field
of
his
vision
The
next
moment
she
was
at
his
throat
her
teeth
buried
in
his
hair
and
flesh
At
first
he
snarled
and
tried
to
fight
but
he
was
very
young
and
this
was
only
his
first
day
in
the
world
and
his
snarl
became
a
whimper
his
fight
a
struggle
to
escape
The
weasel
never
relaxed
her
hold
She
hung
on
striving
to
press
down
with
her
teeth
to
the
great
vein
where
his
lifeblood
bubbled
The
weasel
was
a
drinker
of
blood
and
it
was
ever
her
preference
to
drink
from
the
throat
of
life
itself
The
grey
cub
would
have
died
and
there
would
have
been
no
story
to
write
about
him
had
not
the
shewolf
come
bounding
through
the
bushes
The
weasel
let
go
the
cub
and
flashed
at
the
shewolf’s
throat
missing
but
getting
a
hold
on
the
jaw
instead
The
shewolf
flirted
her
head
like
the
snap
of
a
whip
breaking
the
weasel’s
hold
and
flinging
it
high
in
the
air
And
still
in
the
air
the
shewolf’s
jaws
closed
on
the
lean
yellow
body
and
the
weasel
knew
death
between
the
crunching
teeth
The
cub
experienced
another
access
of
affection
on
the
part
of
his
mother
Her
joy
at
finding
him
seemed
even
greater
than
his
joy
at
being
found
She
nozzled
him
and
caressed
him
and
licked
the
cuts
made
in
him
by
the
weasel’s
teeth
Then
between
them
mother
and
cub
they
ate
the
blooddrinker
and
after
that
went
back
to
the
cave
and
slept
CHAPTER
V
THE
LAW
OF
MEAT
The
cub’s
development
was
rapid
He
rested
for
two
days
and
then
ventured
forth
from
the
cave
again
It
was
on
this
adventure
that
he
found
the
young
weasel
whose
mother
he
had
helped
eat
and
he
saw
to
it
that
the
young
weasel
went
the
way
of
its
mother
But
on
this
trip
he
did
not
get
lost
When
he
grew
tired
he
found
his
way
back
to
the
cave
and
slept
And
every
day
thereafter
found
him
out
and
ranging
a
wider
area
He
began
to
get
accurate
measurement
of
his
strength
and
his
weakness
and
to
know
when
to
be
bold
and
when
to
be
cautious
He
found
it
expedient
to
be
cautious
all
the
time
except
for
the
rare
moments
when
assured
of
his
own
intrepidity
he
abandoned
himself
to
petty
rages
and
lusts
He
was
always
a
little
demon
of
fury
when
he
chanced
upon
a
stray
ptarmigan
Never
did
he
fail
to
respond
savagely
to
the
chatter
of
the
squirrel
he
had
first
met
on
the
blasted
pine
While
the
sight
of
a
moosebird
almost
invariably
put
him
into
the
wildest
of
rages
for
he
never
forgot
the
peck
on
the
nose
he
had
received
from
the
first
of
that
ilk
he
encountered
But
there
were
times
when
even
a
moosebird
failed
to
affect
him
and
those
were
times
when
he
felt
himself
to
be
in
danger
from
some
other
prowling
meat
hunter
He
never
forgot
the
hawk
and
its
moving
shadow
always
sent
him
crouching
into
the
nearest
thicket
He
no
longer
sprawled
and
straddled
and
already
he
was
developing
the
gait
of
his
mother
slinking
and
furtive
apparently
without
exertion
yet
sliding
along
with
a
swiftness
that
was
as
deceptive
as
it
was
imperceptible
In
the
matter
of
meat
his
luck
had
been
all
in
the
beginning
The
seven
ptarmigan
chicks
and
the
baby
weasel
represented
the
sum
of
his
killings
His
desire
to
kill
strengthened
with
the
days
and
he
cherished
hungry
ambitions
for
the
squirrel
that
chattered
so
volubly
and
always
informed
all
wild
creatures
that
the
wolfcub
was
approaching
But
as
birds
flew
in
the
air
squirrels
could
climb
trees
and
the
cub
could
only
try
to
crawl
unobserved
upon
the
squirrel
when
it
was
on
the
ground
The
cub
entertained
a
great
respect
for
his
mother
She
could
get
meat
and
she
never
failed
to
bring
him
his
share
Further
she
was
unafraid
of
things
It
did
not
occur
to
him
that
this
fearlessness
was
founded
upon
experience
and
knowledge
Its
effect
on
him
was
that
of
an
impression
of
power
His
mother
represented
power
and
as
he
grew
older
he
felt
this
power
in
the
sharper
admonishment
of
her
paw
while
the
reproving
nudge
of
her
nose
gave
place
to
the
slash
of
her
fangs
For
this
likewise
he
respected
his
mother
She
compelled
obedience
from
him
and
the
older
he
grew
the
shorter
grew
her
temper
Famine
came
again
and
the
cub
with
clearer
consciousness
knew
once
more
the
bite
of
hunger
The
shewolf
ran
herself
thin
in
the
quest
for
meat
She
rarely
slept
any
more
in
the
cave
spending
most
of
her
time
on
the
meattrail
and
spending
it
vainly
This
famine
was
not
a
long
one
but
it
was
severe
while
it
lasted
The
cub
found
no
more
milk
in
his
mother’s
breast
nor
did
he
get
one
mouthful
of
meat
for
himself
Before
he
had
hunted
in
play
for
the
sheer
joyousness
of
it
now
he
hunted
in
deadly
earnestness
and
found
nothing
Yet
the
failure
of
it
accelerated
his
development
He
studied
the
habits
of
the
squirrel
with
greater
carefulness
and
strove
with
greater
craft
to
steal
upon
it
and
surprise
it
He
studied
the
woodmice
and
tried
to
dig
them
out
of
their
burrows
and
he
learned
much
about
the
ways
of
moosebirds
and
woodpeckers
And
there
came
a
day
when
the
hawk’s
shadow
did
not
drive
him
crouching
into
the
bushes
He
had
grown
stronger
and
wiser
and
more
confident
Also
he
was
desperate
So
he
sat
on
his
haunches
conspicuously
in
an
open
space
and
challenged
the
hawk
down
out
of
the
sky
For
he
knew
that
there
floating
in
the
blue
above
him
was
meat
the
meat
his
stomach
yearned
after
so
insistently
But
the
hawk
refused
to
come
down
and
give
battle
and
the
cub
crawled
away
into
a
thicket
and
whimpered
his
disappointment
and
hunger
The
famine
broke
The
shewolf
brought
home
meat
It
was
strange
meat
different
from
any
she
had
ever
brought
before
It
was
a
lynx
kitten
partly
grown
like
the
cub
but
not
so
large
And
it
was
all
for
him
His
mother
had
satisfied
her
hunger
elsewhere
though
he
did
not
know
that
it
was
the
rest
of
the
lynx
litter
that
had
gone
to
satisfy
her
Nor
did
he
know
the
desperateness
of
her
deed
He
knew
only
that
the
velvetfurred
kitten
was
meat
and
he
ate
and
waxed
happier
with
every
mouthful
A
full
stomach
conduces
to
inaction
and
the
cub
lay
in
the
cave
sleeping
against
his
mother’s
side
He
was
aroused
by
her
snarling
Never
had
he
heard
her
snarl
so
terribly
Possibly
in
her
whole
life
it
was
the
most
terrible
snarl
she
ever
gave
There
was
reason
for
it
and
none
knew
it
better
than
she
A
lynx’s
lair
is
not
despoiled
with
impunity
In
the
full
glare
of
the
afternoon
light
crouching
in
the
entrance
of
the
cave
the
cub
saw
the
lynxmother
The
hair
rippled
up
along
his
back
at
the
sight
Here
was
fear
and
it
did
not
require
his
instinct
to
tell
him
of
it
And
if
sight
alone
were
not
sufficient
the
cry
of
rage
the
intruder
gave
beginning
with
a
snarl
and
rushing
abruptly
upward
into
a
hoarse
screech
was
convincing
enough
in
itself
The
cub
felt
the
prod
of
the
life
that
was
in
him
and
stood
up
and
snarled
valiantly
by
his
mother’s
side
But
she
thrust
him
ignominiously
away
and
behind
her
Because
of
the
lowroofed
entrance
the
lynx
could
not
leap
in
and
when
she
made
a
crawling
rush
of
it
the
shewolf
sprang
upon
her
and
pinned
her
down
The
cub
saw
little
of
the
battle
There
was
a
tremendous
snarling
and
spitting
and
screeching
The
two
animals
threshed
about
the
lynx
ripping
and
tearing
with
her
claws
and
using
her
teeth
as
well
while
the
shewolf
used
her
teeth
alone
Once
the
cub
sprang
in
and
sank
his
teeth
into
the
hind
leg
of
the
lynx
He
clung
on
growling
savagely
Though
he
did
not
know
it
by
the
weight
of
his
body
he
clogged
the
action
of
the
leg
and
thereby
saved
his
mother
much
damage
A
change
in
the
battle
crushed
him
under
both
their
bodies
and
wrenched
loose
his
hold
The
next
moment
the
two
mothers
separated
and
before
they
rushed
together
again
the
lynx
lashed
out
at
the
cub
with
a
huge
forepaw
that
ripped
his
shoulder
open
to
the
bone
and
sent
him
hurtling
sidewise
against
the
wall
Then
was
added
to
the
uproar
the
cub’s
shrill
yelp
of
pain
and
fright
But
the
fight
lasted
so
long
that
he
had
time
to
cry
himself
out
and
to
experience
a
second
burst
of
courage
and
the
end
of
the
battle
found
him
again
clinging
to
a
hindleg
and
furiously
growling
between
his
teeth
The
lynx
was
dead
But
the
shewolf
was
very
weak
and
sick
At
first
she
caressed
the
cub
and
licked
his
wounded
shoulder
but
the
blood
she
had
lost
had
taken
with
it
her
strength
and
for
all
of
a
day
and
a
night
she
lay
by
her
dead
foe’s
side
without
movement
scarcely
breathing
For
a
week
she
never
left
the
cave
except
for
water
and
then
her
movements
were
slow
and
painful
At
the
end
of
that
time
the
lynx
was
devoured
while
the
shewolf’s
wounds
had
healed
sufficiently
to
permit
her
to
take
the
meattrail
again
The
cub’s
shoulder
was
stiff
and
sore
and
for
some
time
he
limped
from
the
terrible
slash
he
had
received
But
the
world
now
seemed
changed
He
went
about
in
it
with
greater
confidence
with
a
feeling
of
prowess
that
had
not
been
his
in
the
days
before
the
battle
with
the
lynx
He
had
looked
upon
life
in
a
more
ferocious
aspect
he
had
fought
he
had
buried
his
teeth
in
the
flesh
of
a
foe
and
he
had
survived
And
because
of
all
this
he
carried
himself
more
boldly
with
a
touch
of
defiance
that
was
new
in
him
He
was
no
longer
afraid
of
minor
things
and
much
of
his
timidity
had
vanished
though
the
unknown
never
ceased
to
press
upon
him
with
its
mysteries
and
terrors
intangible
and
evermenacing
He
began
to
accompany
his
mother
on
the
meattrail
and
he
saw
much
of
the
killing
of
meat
and
began
to
play
his
part
in
it
And
in
his
own
dim
way
he
learned
the
law
of
meat
There
were
two
kinds
of
life—his
own
kind
and
the
other
kind
His
own
kind
included
his
mother
and
himself
The
other
kind
included
all
live
things
that
moved
But
the
other
kind
was
divided
One
portion
was
what
his
own
kind
killed
and
ate
This
portion
was
composed
of
the
nonkillers
and
the
small
killers
The
other
portion
killed
and
ate
his
own
kind
or
was
killed
and
eaten
by
his
own
kind
And
out
of
this
classification
arose
the
law
The
aim
of
life
was
meat
Life
itself
was
meat
Life
lived
on
life
There
were
the
eaters
and
the
eaten
The
law
was
EAT
OR
BE
EATEN
He
did
not
formulate
the
law
in
clear
set
terms
and
moralise
about
it
He
did
not
even
think
the
law
he
merely
lived
the
law
without
thinking
about
it
at
all
He
saw
the
law
operating
around
him
on
every
side
He
had
eaten
the
ptarmigan
chicks
The
hawk
had
eaten
the
ptarmiganmother
The
hawk
would
also
have
eaten
him
Later
when
he
had
grown
more
formidable
he
wanted
to
eat
the
hawk
He
had
eaten
the
lynx
kitten
The
lynxmother
would
have
eaten
him
had
she
not
herself
been
killed
and
eaten
And
so
it
went
The
law
was
being
lived
about
him
by
all
live
things
and
he
himself
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
law
He
was
a
killer
His
only
food
was
meat
live
meat
that
ran
away
swiftly
before
him
or
flew
into
the
air
or
climbed
trees
or
hid
in
the
ground
or
faced
him
and
fought
with
him
or
turned
the
tables
and
ran
after
him
Had
the
cub
thought
in
manfashion
he
might
have
epitomised
life
as
a
voracious
appetite
and
the
world
as
a
place
wherein
ranged
a
multitude
of
appetites
pursuing
and
being
pursued
hunting
and
being
hunted
eating
and
being
eaten
all
in
blindness
and
confusion
with
violence
and
disorder
a
chaos
of
gluttony
and
slaughter
ruled
over
by
chance
merciless
planless
endless
But
the
cub
did
not
think
in
manfashion
He
did
not
look
at
things
with
wide
vision
He
was
singlepurposed
and
entertained
but
one
thought
or
desire
at
a
time
Besides
the
law
of
meat
there
were
a
myriad
other
and
lesser
laws
for
him
to
learn
and
obey
The
world
was
filled
with
surprise
The
stir
of
the
life
that
was
in
him
the
play
of
his
muscles
was
an
unending
happiness
To
run
down
meat
was
to
experience
thrills
and
elations
His
rages
and
battles
were
pleasures
Terror
itself
and
the
mystery
of
the
unknown
led
to
his
living
And
there
were
easements
and
satisfactions
To
have
a
full
stomach
to
doze
lazily
in
the
sunshine—such
things
were
remuneration
in
full
for
his
ardours
and
toils
while
his
ardours
and
tolls
were
in
themselves
selfremunerative
They
were
expressions
of
life
and
life
is
always
happy
when
it
is
expressing
itself
So
the
cub
had
no
quarrel
with
his
hostile
environment
He
was
very
much
alive
very
happy
and
very
proud
of
himself
PART
III
CHAPTER
I
THE
MAKERS
OF
FIRE
The
cub
came
upon
it
suddenly
It
was
his
own
fault
He
had
been
careless
He
had
left
the
cave
and
run
down
to
the
stream
to
drink
It
might
have
been
that
he
took
no
notice
because
he
was
heavy
with
sleep
He
had
been
out
all
night
on
the
meattrail
and
had
but
just
then
awakened
And
his
carelessness
might
have
been
due
to
the
familiarity
of
the
trail
to
the
pool
He
had
travelled
it
often
and
nothing
had
ever
happened
on
it
He
went
down
past
the
blasted
pine
crossed
the
open
space
and
trotted
in
amongst
the
trees
Then
at
the
same
instant
he
saw
and
smelt
Before
him
sitting
silently
on
their
haunches
were
five
live
things
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
seen
before
It
was
his
first
glimpse
of
mankind
But
at
the
sight
of
him
the
five
men
did
not
spring
to
their
feet
nor
show
their
teeth
nor
snarl
They
did
not
move
but
sat
there
silent
and
ominous
Nor
did
the
cub
move
Every
instinct
of
his
nature
would
have
impelled
him
to
dash
wildly
away
had
there
not
suddenly
and
for
the
first
time
arisen
in
him
another
and
counter
instinct
A
great
awe
descended
upon
him
He
was
beaten
down
to
movelessness
by
an
overwhelming
sense
of
his
own
weakness
and
littleness
Here
was
mastery
and
power
something
far
and
away
beyond
him
The
cub
had
never
seen
man
yet
the
instinct
concerning
man
was
his
In
dim
ways
he
recognised
in
man
the
animal
that
had
fought
itself
to
primacy
over
the
other
animals
of
the
Wild
Not
alone
out
of
his
own
eyes
but
out
of
the
eyes
of
all
his
ancestors
was
the
cub
now
looking
upon
man—out
of
eyes
that
had
circled
in
the
darkness
around
countless
winter
campfires
that
had
peered
from
safe
distances
and
from
the
hearts
of
thickets
at
the
strange
twolegged
animal
that
was
lord
over
living
things
The
spell
of
the
cub’s
heritage
was
upon
him
the
fear
and
the
respect
born
of
the
centuries
of
struggle
and
the
accumulated
experience
of
the
generations
The
heritage
was
too
compelling
for
a
wolf
that
was
only
a
cub
Had
he
been
fullgrown
he
would
have
run
away
As
it
was
he
cowered
down
in
a
paralysis
of
fear
already
half
proffering
the
submission
that
his
kind
had
proffered
from
the
first
time
a
wolf
came
in
to
sit
by
man’s
fire
and
be
made
warm
One
of
the
Indians
arose
and
walked
over
to
him
and
stooped
above
him
The
cub
cowered
closer
to
the
ground
It
was
the
unknown
objectified
at
last
in
concrete
flesh
and
blood
bending
over
him
and
reaching
down
to
seize
hold
of
him
His
hair
bristled
involuntarily
his
lips
writhed
back
and
his
little
fangs
were
bared
The
hand
poised
like
doom
above
him
hesitated
and
the
man
spoke
laughing
“Wabam
wabisca
ip
pit
tah”
“Look
The
white
fangs”
The
other
Indians
laughed
loudly
and
urged
the
man
on
to
pick
up
the
cub
As
the
hand
descended
closer
and
closer
there
raged
within
the
cub
a
battle
of
the
instincts
He
experienced
two
great
impulsions—to
yield
and
to
fight
The
resulting
action
was
a
compromise
He
did
both
He
yielded
till
the
hand
almost
touched
him
Then
he
fought
his
teeth
flashing
in
a
snap
that
sank
them
into
the
hand
The
next
moment
he
received
a
clout
alongside
the
head
that
knocked
him
over
on
his
side
Then
all
fight
fled
out
of
him
His
puppyhood
and
the
instinct
of
submission
took
charge
of
him
He
sat
up
on
his
haunches
and
kiyi’d
But
the
man
whose
hand
he
had
bitten
was
angry
The
cub
received
a
clout
on
the
other
side
of
his
head
Whereupon
he
sat
up
and
kiyi’d
louder
than
ever
The
four
Indians
laughed
more
loudly
while
even
the
man
who
had
been
bitten
began
to
laugh
They
surrounded
the
cub
and
laughed
at
him
while
he
wailed
out
his
terror
and
his
hurt
In
the
midst
of
it
he
heard
something
The
Indians
heard
it
too
But
the
cub
knew
what
it
was
and
with
a
last
long
wail
that
had
in
it
more
of
triumph
than
grief
he
ceased
his
noise
and
waited
for
the
coming
of
his
mother
of
his
ferocious
and
indomitable
mother
who
fought
and
killed
all
things
and
was
never
afraid
She
was
snarling
as
she
ran
She
had
heard
the
cry
of
her
cub
and
was
dashing
to
save
him
She
bounded
in
amongst
them
her
anxious
and
militant
motherhood
making
her
anything
but
a
pretty
sight
But
to
the
cub
the
spectacle
of
her
protective
rage
was
pleasing
He
uttered
a
glad
little
cry
and
bounded
to
meet
her
while
the
mananimals
went
back
hastily
several
steps
The
shewolf
stood
over
against
her
cub
facing
the
men
with
bristling
hair
a
snarl
rumbling
deep
in
her
throat
Her
face
was
distorted
and
malignant
with
menace
even
the
bridge
of
the
nose
wrinkling
from
tip
to
eyes
so
prodigious
was
her
snarl
Then
it
was
that
a
cry
went
up
from
one
of
the
men
“Kiche”
was
what
he
uttered
It
was
an
exclamation
of
surprise
The
cub
felt
his
mother
wilting
at
the
sound
“Kiche”
the
man
cried
again
this
time
with
sharpness
and
authority
And
then
the
cub
saw
his
mother
the
shewolf
the
fearless
one
crouching
down
till
her
belly
touched
the
ground
whimpering
wagging
her
tail
making
peace
signs
The
cub
could
not
understand
He
was
appalled
The
awe
of
man
rushed
over
him
again
His
instinct
had
been
true
His
mother
verified
it
She
too
rendered
submission
to
the
mananimals
The
man
who
had
spoken
came
over
to
her
He
put
his
hand
upon
her
head
and
she
only
crouched
closer
She
did
not
snap
nor
threaten
to
snap
The
other
men
came
up
and
surrounded
her
and
felt
her
and
pawed
her
which
actions
she
made
no
attempt
to
resent
They
were
greatly
excited
and
made
many
noises
with
their
mouths
These
noises
were
not
indication
of
danger
the
cub
decided
as
he
crouched
near
his
mother
still
bristling
from
time
to
time
but
doing
his
best
to
submit
“It
is
not
strange”
an
Indian
was
saying
“Her
father
was
a
wolf
It
is
true
her
mother
was
a
dog
but
did
not
my
brother
tie
her
out
in
the
woods
all
of
three
nights
in
the
mating
season
Therefore
was
the
father
of
Kiche
a
wolf”
“It
is
a
year
Grey
Beaver
since
she
ran
away”
spoke
a
second
Indian
“It
is
not
strange
Salmon
Tongue”
Grey
Beaver
answered
“It
was
the
time
of
the
famine
and
there
was
no
meat
for
the
dogs”
“She
has
lived
with
the
wolves”
said
a
third
Indian
“So
it
would
seem
Three
Eagles”
Grey
Beaver
answered
laying
his
hand
on
the
cub
“and
this
be
the
sign
of
it”
The
cub
snarled
a
little
at
the
touch
of
the
hand
and
the
hand
flew
back
to
administer
a
clout
Whereupon
the
cub
covered
its
fangs
and
sank
down
submissively
while
the
hand
returning
rubbed
behind
his
ears
and
up
and
down
his
back
“This
be
the
sign
of
it”
Grey
Beaver
went
on
“It
is
plain
that
his
mother
is
Kiche
But
his
father
was
a
wolf
Wherefore
is
there
in
him
little
dog
and
much
wolf
His
fangs
be
white
and
White
Fang
shall
be
his
name
I
have
spoken
He
is
my
dog
For
was
not
Kiche
my
brother’s
dog
And
is
not
my
brother
dead”
The
cub
who
had
thus
received
a
name
in
the
world
lay
and
watched
For
a
time
the
mananimals
continued
to
make
their
mouthnoises
Then
Grey
Beaver
took
a
knife
from
a
sheath
that
hung
around
his
neck
and
went
into
the
thicket
and
cut
a
stick
White
Fang
watched
him
He
notched
the
stick
at
each
end
and
in
the
notches
fastened
strings
of
rawhide
One
string
he
tied
around
the
throat
of
Kiche
Then
he
led
her
to
a
small
pine
around
which
he
tied
the
other
string
White
Fang
followed
and
lay
down
beside
her
Salmon
Tongue’s
hand
reached
out
to
him
and
rolled
him
over
on
his
back
Kiche
looked
on
anxiously
White
Fang
felt
fear
mounting
in
him
again
He
could
not
quite
suppress
a
snarl
but
he
made
no
offer
to
snap
The
hand
with
fingers
crooked
and
spread
apart
rubbed
his
stomach
in
a
playful
way
and
rolled
him
from
side
to
side
It
was
ridiculous
and
ungainly
lying
there
on
his
back
with
legs
sprawling
in
the
air
Besides
it
was
a
position
of
such
utter
helplessness
that
White
Fang’s
whole
nature
revolted
against
it
He
could
do
nothing
to
defend
himself
If
this
mananimal
intended
harm
White
Fang
knew
that
he
could
not
escape
it
How
could
he
spring
away
with
his
four
legs
in
the
air
above
him
Yet
submission
made
him
master
his
fear
and
he
only
growled
softly
This
growl
he
could
not
suppress
nor
did
the
mananimal
resent
it
by
giving
him
a
blow
on
the
head
And
furthermore
such
was
the
strangeness
of
it
White
Fang
experienced
an
unaccountable
sensation
of
pleasure
as
the
hand
rubbed
back
and
forth
When
he
was
rolled
on
his
side
he
ceased
to
growl
when
the
fingers
pressed
and
prodded
at
the
base
of
his
ears
the
pleasurable
sensation
increased
and
when
with
a
final
rub
and
scratch
the
man
left
him
alone
and
went
away
all
fear
had
died
out
of
White
Fang
He
was
to
know
fear
many
times
in
his
dealing
with
man
yet
it
was
a
token
of
the
fearless
companionship
with
man
that
was
ultimately
to
be
his
After
a
time
White
Fang
heard
strange
noises
approaching
He
was
quick
in
his
classification
for
he
knew
them
at
once
for
mananimal
noises
A
few
minutes
later
the
remainder
of
the
tribe
strung
out
as
it
was
on
the
march
trailed
in
There
were
more
men
and
many
women
and
children
forty
souls
of
them
and
all
heavily
burdened
with
camp
equipage
and
outfit
Also
there
were
many
dogs
and
these
with
the
exception
of
the
partgrown
puppies
were
likewise
burdened
with
camp
outfit
On
their
backs
in
bags
that
fastened
tightly
around
underneath
the
dogs
carried
from
twenty
to
thirty
pounds
of
weight
White
Fang
had
never
seen
dogs
before
but
at
sight
of
them
he
felt
that
they
were
his
own
kind
only
somehow
different
But
they
displayed
little
difference
from
the
wolf
when
they
discovered
the
cub
and
his
mother
There
was
a
rush
White
Fang
bristled
and
snarled
and
snapped
in
the
face
of
the
openmouthed
oncoming
wave
of
dogs
and
went
down
and
under
them
feeling
the
sharp
slash
of
teeth
in
his
body
himself
biting
and
tearing
at
the
legs
and
bellies
above
him
There
was
a
great
uproar
He
could
hear
the
snarl
of
Kiche
as
she
fought
for
him
and
he
could
hear
the
cries
of
the
mananimals
the
sound
of
clubs
striking
upon
bodies
and
the
yelps
of
pain
from
the
dogs
so
struck
Only
a
few
seconds
elapsed
before
he
was
on
his
feet
again
He
could
now
see
the
mananimals
driving
back
the
dogs
with
clubs
and
stones
defending
him
saving
him
from
the
savage
teeth
of
his
kind
that
somehow
was
not
his
kind
And
though
there
was
no
reason
in
his
brain
for
a
clear
conception
of
so
abstract
a
thing
as
justice
nevertheless
in
his
own
way
he
felt
the
justice
of
the
mananimals
and
he
knew
them
for
what
they
were—makers
of
law
and
executors
of
law
Also
he
appreciated
the
power
with
which
they
administered
the
law
Unlike
any
animals
he
had
ever
encountered
they
did
not
bite
nor
claw
They
enforced
their
live
strength
with
the
power
of
dead
things
Dead
things
did
their
bidding
Thus
sticks
and
stones
directed
by
these
strange
creatures
leaped
through
the
air
like
living
things
inflicting
grievous
hurts
upon
the
dogs
To
his
mind
this
was
power
unusual
power
inconceivable
and
beyond
the
natural
power
that
was
godlike
White
Fang
in
the
very
nature
of
him
could
never
know
anything
about
gods
at
the
best
he
could
know
only
things
that
were
beyond
knowing—but
the
wonder
and
awe
that
he
had
of
these
mananimals
in
ways
resembled
what
would
be
the
wonder
and
awe
of
man
at
sight
of
some
celestial
creature
on
a
mountain
top
hurling
thunderbolts
from
either
hand
at
an
astonished
world
The
last
dog
had
been
driven
back
The
hubbub
died
down
And
White
Fang
licked
his
hurts
and
meditated
upon
this
his
first
taste
of
packcruelty
and
his
introduction
to
the
pack
He
had
never
dreamed
that
his
own
kind
consisted
of
more
than
One
Eye
his
mother
and
himself
They
had
constituted
a
kind
apart
and
here
abruptly
he
had
discovered
many
more
creatures
apparently
of
his
own
kind
And
there
was
a
subconscious
resentment
that
these
his
kind
at
first
sight
had
pitched
upon
him
and
tried
to
destroy
him
In
the
same
way
he
resented
his
mother
being
tied
with
a
stick
even
though
it
was
done
by
the
superior
mananimals
It
savoured
of
the
trap
of
bondage
Yet
of
the
trap
and
of
bondage
he
knew
nothing
Freedom
to
roam
and
run
and
lie
down
at
will
had
been
his
heritage
and
here
it
was
being
infringed
upon
His
mother’s
movements
were
restricted
to
the
length
of
a
stick
and
by
the
length
of
that
same
stick
was
he
restricted
for
he
had
not
yet
got
beyond
the
need
of
his
mother’s
side
He
did
not
like
it
Nor
did
he
like
it
when
the
mananimals
arose
and
went
on
with
their
march
for
a
tiny
mananimal
took
the
other
end
of
the
stick
and
led
Kiche
captive
behind
him
and
behind
Kiche
followed
White
Fang
greatly
perturbed
and
worried
by
this
new
adventure
he
had
entered
upon
They
went
down
the
valley
of
the
stream
far
beyond
White
Fang’s
widest
ranging
until
they
came
to
the
end
of
the
valley
where
the
stream
ran
into
the
Mackenzie
River
Here
where
canoes
were
cached
on
poles
high
in
the
air
and
where
stood
fishracks
for
the
drying
of
fish
camp
was
made
and
White
Fang
looked
on
with
wondering
eyes
The
superiority
of
these
mananimals
increased
with
every
moment
There
was
their
mastery
over
all
these
sharpfanged
dogs
It
breathed
of
power
But
greater
than
that
to
the
wolfcub
was
their
mastery
over
things
not
alive
their
capacity
to
communicate
motion
to
unmoving
things
their
capacity
to
change
the
very
face
of
the
world
It
was
this
last
that
especially
affected
him
The
elevation
of
frames
of
poles
caught
his
eye
yet
this
in
itself
was
not
so
remarkable
being
done
by
the
same
creatures
that
flung
sticks
and
stones
to
great
distances
But
when
the
frames
of
poles
were
made
into
tepees
by
being
covered
with
cloth
and
skins
White
Fang
was
astounded
It
was
the
colossal
bulk
of
them
that
impressed
him
They
arose
around
him
on
every
side
like
some
monstrous
quickgrowing
form
of
life
They
occupied
nearly
the
whole
circumference
of
his
field
of
vision
He
was
afraid
of
them
They
loomed
ominously
above
him
and
when
the
breeze
stirred
them
into
huge
movements
he
cowered
down
in
fear
keeping
his
eyes
warily
upon
them
and
prepared
to
spring
away
if
they
attempted
to
precipitate
themselves
upon
him
But
in
a
short
while
his
fear
of
the
tepees
passed
away
He
saw
the
women
and
children
passing
in
and
out
of
them
without
harm
and
he
saw
the
dogs
trying
often
to
get
into
them
and
being
driven
away
with
sharp
words
and
flying
stones
After
a
time
he
left
Kiche’s
side
and
crawled
cautiously
toward
the
wall
of
the
nearest
tepee
It
was
the
curiosity
of
growth
that
urged
him
on—the
necessity
of
learning
and
living
and
doing
that
brings
experience
The
last
few
inches
to
the
wall
of
the
tepee
were
crawled
with
painful
slowness
and
precaution
The
day’s
events
had
prepared
him
for
the
unknown
to
manifest
itself
in
most
stupendous
and
unthinkable
ways
At
last
his
nose
touched
the
canvas
He
waited
Nothing
happened
Then
he
smelled
the
strange
fabric
saturated
with
the
mansmell
He
closed
on
the
canvas
with
his
teeth
and
gave
a
gentle
tug
Nothing
happened
though
the
adjacent
portions
of
the
tepee
moved
He
tugged
harder
There
was
a
greater
movement
It
was
delightful
He
tugged
still
harder
and
repeatedly
until
the
whole
tepee
was
in
motion
Then
the
sharp
cry
of
a
squaw
inside
sent
him
scampering
back
to
Kiche
But
after
that
he
was
afraid
no
more
of
the
looming
bulks
of
the
tepees
A
moment
later
he
was
straying
away
again
from
his
mother
Her
stick
was
tied
to
a
peg
in
the
ground
and
she
could
not
follow
him
A
partgrown
puppy
somewhat
larger
and
older
than
he
came
toward
him
slowly
with
ostentatious
and
belligerent
importance
The
puppy’s
name
as
White
Fang
was
afterward
to
hear
him
called
was
Liplip
He
had
had
experience
in
puppy
fights
and
was
already
something
of
a
bully
Liplip
was
White
Fang’s
own
kind
and
being
only
a
puppy
did
not
seem
dangerous
so
White
Fang
prepared
to
meet
him
in
a
friendly
spirit
But
when
the
strangers
walk
became
stifflegged
and
his
lips
lifted
clear
of
his
teeth
White
Fang
stiffened
too
and
answered
with
lifted
lips
They
half
circled
about
each
other
tentatively
snarling
and
bristling
This
lasted
several
minutes
and
White
Fang
was
beginning
to
enjoy
it
as
a
sort
of
game
But
suddenly
with
remarkable
swiftness
Liplip
leaped
in
delivering
a
slashing
snap
and
leaped
away
again
The
snap
had
taken
effect
on
the
shoulder
that
had
been
hurt
by
the
lynx
and
that
was
still
sore
deep
down
near
the
bone
The
surprise
and
hurt
of
it
brought
a
yelp
out
of
White
Fang
but
the
next
moment
in
a
rush
of
anger
he
was
upon
Liplip
and
snapping
viciously
But
Liplip
had
lived
his
life
in
camp
and
had
fought
many
puppy
fights
Three
times
four
times
and
half
a
dozen
times
his
sharp
little
teeth
scored
on
the
newcomer
until
White
Fang
yelping
shamelessly
fled
to
the
protection
of
his
mother
It
was
the
first
of
the
many
fights
he
was
to
have
with
Liplip
for
they
were
enemies
from
the
start
born
so
with
natures
destined
perpetually
to
clash
Kiche
licked
White
Fang
soothingly
with
her
tongue
and
tried
to
prevail
upon
him
to
remain
with
her
But
his
curiosity
was
rampant
and
several
minutes
later
he
was
venturing
forth
on
a
new
quest
He
came
upon
one
of
the
mananimals
Grey
Beaver
who
was
squatting
on
his
hams
and
doing
something
with
sticks
and
dry
moss
spread
before
him
on
the
ground
White
Fang
came
near
to
him
and
watched
Grey
Beaver
made
mouthnoises
which
White
Fang
interpreted
as
not
hostile
so
he
came
still
nearer
Women
and
children
were
carrying
more
sticks
and
branches
to
Grey
Beaver
It
was
evidently
an
affair
of
moment
White
Fang
came
in
until
he
touched
Grey
Beaver’s
knee
so
curious
was
he
and
already
forgetful
that
this
was
a
terrible
mananimal
Suddenly
he
saw
a
strange
thing
like
mist
beginning
to
arise
from
the
sticks
and
moss
beneath
Grey
Beaver’s
hands
Then
amongst
the
sticks
themselves
appeared
a
live
thing
twisting
and
turning
of
a
colour
like
the
colour
of
the
sun
in
the
sky
White
Fang
knew
nothing
about
fire
It
drew
him
as
the
light
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
had
drawn
him
in
his
early
puppyhood
He
crawled
the
several
steps
toward
the
flame
He
heard
Grey
Beaver
chuckle
above
him
and
he
knew
the
sound
was
not
hostile
Then
his
nose
touched
the
flame
and
at
the
same
instant
his
little
tongue
went
out
to
it
For
a
moment
he
was
paralysed
The
unknown
lurking
in
the
midst
of
the
sticks
and
moss
was
savagely
clutching
him
by
the
nose
He
scrambled
backward
bursting
out
in
an
astonished
explosion
of
kiyi’s
At
the
sound
Kiche
leaped
snarling
to
the
end
of
her
stick
and
there
raged
terribly
because
she
could
not
come
to
his
aid
But
Grey
Beaver
laughed
loudly
and
slapped
his
thighs
and
told
the
happening
to
all
the
rest
of
the
camp
till
everybody
was
laughing
uproariously
But
White
Fang
sat
on
his
haunches
and
kiyi’d
and
kiyi’d
a
forlorn
and
pitiable
little
figure
in
the
midst
of
the
mananimals
It
was
the
worst
hurt
he
had
ever
known
Both
nose
and
tongue
had
been
scorched
by
the
live
thing
suncoloured
that
had
grown
up
under
Grey
Beaver’s
hands
He
cried
and
cried
interminably
and
every
fresh
wail
was
greeted
by
bursts
of
laughter
on
the
part
of
the
mananimals
He
tried
to
soothe
his
nose
with
his
tongue
but
the
tongue
was
burnt
too
and
the
two
hurts
coming
together
produced
greater
hurt
whereupon
he
cried
more
hopelessly
and
helplessly
than
ever
And
then
shame
came
to
him
He
knew
laughter
and
the
meaning
of
it
It
is
not
given
us
to
know
how
some
animals
know
laughter
and
know
when
they
are
being
laughed
at
but
it
was
this
same
way
that
White
Fang
knew
it
And
he
felt
shame
that
the
mananimals
should
be
laughing
at
him
He
turned
and
fled
away
not
from
the
hurt
of
the
fire
but
from
the
laughter
that
sank
even
deeper
and
hurt
in
the
spirit
of
him
And
he
fled
to
Kiche
raging
at
the
end
of
her
stick
like
an
animal
gone
mad—to
Kiche
the
one
creature
in
the
world
who
was
not
laughing
at
him
Twilight
drew
down
and
night
came
on
and
White
Fang
lay
by
his
mother’s
side
His
nose
and
tongue
still
hurt
but
he
was
perplexed
by
a
greater
trouble
He
was
homesick
He
felt
a
vacancy
in
him
a
need
for
the
hush
and
quietude
of
the
stream
and
the
cave
in
the
cliff
Life
had
become
too
populous
There
were
so
many
of
the
mananimals
men
women
and
children
all
making
noises
and
irritations
And
there
were
the
dogs
ever
squabbling
and
bickering
bursting
into
uproars
and
creating
confusions
The
restful
loneliness
of
the
only
life
he
had
known
was
gone
Here
the
very
air
was
palpitant
with
life
It
hummed
and
buzzed
unceasingly
Continually
changing
its
intensity
and
abruptly
variant
in
pitch
it
impinged
on
his
nerves
and
senses
made
him
nervous
and
restless
and
worried
him
with
a
perpetual
imminence
of
happening
He
watched
the
mananimals
coming
and
going
and
moving
about
the
camp
In
fashion
distantly
resembling
the
way
men
look
upon
the
gods
they
create
so
looked
White
Fang
upon
the
mananimals
before
him
They
were
superior
creatures
of
a
verity
gods
To
his
dim
comprehension
they
were
as
much
wonderworkers
as
gods
are
to
men
They
were
creatures
of
mastery
possessing
all
manner
of
unknown
and
impossible
potencies
overlords
of
the
alive
and
the
not
alive—making
obey
that
which
moved
imparting
movement
to
that
which
did
not
move
and
making
life
suncoloured
and
biting
life
to
grow
out
of
dead
moss
and
wood
They
were
firemakers
They
were
gods
CHAPTER
II
THE
BONDAGE
The
days
were
thronged
with
experience
for
White
Fang
During
the
time
that
Kiche
was
tied
by
the
stick
he
ran
about
over
all
the
camp
inquiring
investigating
learning
He
quickly
came
to
know
much
of
the
ways
of
the
mananimals
but
familiarity
did
not
breed
contempt
The
more
he
came
to
know
them
the
more
they
vindicated
their
superiority
the
more
they
displayed
their
mysterious
powers
the
greater
loomed
their
godlikeness
To
man
has
been
given
the
grief
often
of
seeing
his
gods
overthrown
and
his
altars
crumbling
but
to
the
wolf
and
the
wild
dog
that
have
come
in
to
crouch
at
man’s
feet
this
grief
has
never
come
Unlike
man
whose
gods
are
of
the
unseen
and
the
overguessed
vapours
and
mists
of
fancy
eluding
the
garmenture
of
reality
wandering
wraiths
of
desired
goodness
and
power
intangible
outcroppings
of
self
into
the
realm
of
spirit—unlike
man
the
wolf
and
the
wild
dog
that
have
come
in
to
the
fire
find
their
gods
in
the
living
flesh
solid
to
the
touch
occupying
earthspace
and
requiring
time
for
the
accomplishment
of
their
ends
and
their
existence
No
effort
of
faith
is
necessary
to
believe
in
such
a
god
no
effort
of
will
can
possibly
induce
disbelief
in
such
a
god
There
is
no
getting
away
from
it
There
it
stands
on
its
two
hindlegs
club
in
hand
immensely
potential
passionate
and
wrathful
and
loving
god
and
mystery
and
power
all
wrapped
up
and
around
by
flesh
that
bleeds
when
it
is
torn
and
that
is
good
to
eat
like
any
flesh
And
so
it
was
with
White
Fang
The
mananimals
were
gods
unmistakable
and
unescapable
As
his
mother
Kiche
had
rendered
her
allegiance
to
them
at
the
first
cry
of
her
name
so
he
was
beginning
to
render
his
allegiance
He
gave
them
the
trail
as
a
privilege
indubitably
theirs
When
they
walked
he
got
out
of
their
way
When
they
called
he
came
When
they
threatened
he
cowered
down
When
they
commanded
him
to
go
he
went
away
hurriedly
For
behind
any
wish
of
theirs
was
power
to
enforce
that
wish
power
that
hurt
power
that
expressed
itself
in
clouts
and
clubs
in
flying
stones
and
stinging
lashes
of
whips
He
belonged
to
them
as
all
dogs
belonged
to
them
His
actions
were
theirs
to
command
His
body
was
theirs
to
maul
to
stamp
upon
to
tolerate
Such
was
the
lesson
that
was
quickly
borne
in
upon
him
It
came
hard
going
as
it
did
counter
to
much
that
was
strong
and
dominant
in
his
own
nature
and
while
he
disliked
it
in
the
learning
of
it
unknown
to
himself
he
was
learning
to
like
it
It
was
a
placing
of
his
destiny
in
another’s
hands
a
shifting
of
the
responsibilities
of
existence
This
in
itself
was
compensation
for
it
is
always
easier
to
lean
upon
another
than
to
stand
alone
But
it
did
not
all
happen
in
a
day
this
giving
over
of
himself
body
and
soul
to
the
mananimals
He
could
not
immediately
forego
his
wild
heritage
and
his
memories
of
the
Wild
There
were
days
when
he
crept
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
stood
and
listened
to
something
calling
him
far
and
away
And
always
he
returned
restless
and
uncomfortable
to
whimper
softly
and
wistfully
at
Kiche’s
side
and
to
lick
her
face
with
eager
questioning
tongue
White
Fang
learned
rapidly
the
ways
of
the
camp
He
knew
the
injustice
and
greediness
of
the
older
dogs
when
meat
or
fish
was
thrown
out
to
be
eaten
He
came
to
know
that
men
were
more
just
children
more
cruel
and
women
more
kindly
and
more
likely
to
toss
him
a
bit
of
meat
or
bone
And
after
two
or
three
painful
adventures
with
the
mothers
of
partgrown
puppies
he
came
into
the
knowledge
that
it
was
always
good
policy
to
let
such
mothers
alone
to
keep
away
from
them
as
far
as
possible
and
to
avoid
them
when
he
saw
them
coming
But
the
bane
of
his
life
was
Liplip
Larger
older
and
stronger
Liplip
had
selected
White
Fang
for
his
special
object
of
persecution
White
Fang
fought
willingly
enough
but
he
was
outclassed
His
enemy
was
too
big
Liplip
became
a
nightmare
to
him
Whenever
he
ventured
away
from
his
mother
the
bully
was
sure
to
appear
trailing
at
his
heels
snarling
at
him
picking
upon
him
and
watchful
of
an
opportunity
when
no
mananimal
was
near
to
spring
upon
him
and
force
a
fight
As
Liplip
invariably
won
he
enjoyed
it
hugely
It
became
his
chief
delight
in
life
as
it
became
White
Fang’s
chief
torment
But
the
effect
upon
White
Fang
was
not
to
cow
him
Though
he
suffered
most
of
the
damage
and
was
always
defeated
his
spirit
remained
unsubdued
Yet
a
bad
effect
was
produced
He
became
malignant
and
morose
His
temper
had
been
savage
by
birth
but
it
became
more
savage
under
this
unending
persecution
The
genial
playful
puppyish
side
of
him
found
little
expression
He
never
played
and
gambolled
about
with
the
other
puppies
of
the
camp
Liplip
would
not
permit
it
The
moment
White
Fang
appeared
near
them
Liplip
was
upon
him
bullying
and
hectoring
him
or
fighting
with
him
until
he
had
driven
him
away
The
effect
of
all
this
was
to
rob
White
Fang
of
much
of
his
puppyhood
and
to
make
him
in
his
comportment
older
than
his
age
Denied
the
outlet
through
play
of
his
energies
he
recoiled
upon
himself
and
developed
his
mental
processes
He
became
cunning
he
had
idle
time
in
which
to
devote
himself
to
thoughts
of
trickery
Prevented
from
obtaining
his
share
of
meat
and
fish
when
a
general
feed
was
given
to
the
campdogs
he
became
a
clever
thief
He
had
to
forage
for
himself
and
he
foraged
well
though
he
was
ofttimes
a
plague
to
the
squaws
in
consequence
He
learned
to
sneak
about
camp
to
be
crafty
to
know
what
was
going
on
everywhere
to
see
and
to
hear
everything
and
to
reason
accordingly
and
successfully
to
devise
ways
and
means
of
avoiding
his
implacable
persecutor
It
was
early
in
the
days
of
his
persecution
that
he
played
his
first
really
big
crafty
game
and
got
there
from
his
first
taste
of
revenge
As
Kiche
when
with
the
wolves
had
lured
out
to
destruction
dogs
from
the
camps
of
men
so
White
Fang
in
manner
somewhat
similar
lured
Liplip
into
Kiche’s
avenging
jaws
Retreating
before
Liplip
White
Fang
made
an
indirect
flight
that
led
in
and
out
and
around
the
various
tepees
of
the
camp
He
was
a
good
runner
swifter
than
any
puppy
of
his
size
and
swifter
than
Liplip
But
he
did
not
run
his
best
in
this
chase
He
barely
held
his
own
one
leap
ahead
of
his
pursuer
Liplip
excited
by
the
chase
and
by
the
persistent
nearness
of
his
victim
forgot
caution
and
locality
When
he
remembered
locality
it
was
too
late
Dashing
at
top
speed
around
a
tepee
he
ran
full
tilt
into
Kiche
lying
at
the
end
of
her
stick
He
gave
one
yelp
of
consternation
and
then
her
punishing
jaws
closed
upon
him
She
was
tied
but
he
could
not
get
away
from
her
easily
She
rolled
him
off
his
legs
so
that
he
could
not
run
while
she
repeatedly
ripped
and
slashed
him
with
her
fangs
When
at
last
he
succeeded
in
rolling
clear
of
her
he
crawled
to
his
feet
badly
dishevelled
hurt
both
in
body
and
in
spirit
His
hair
was
standing
out
all
over
him
in
tufts
where
her
teeth
had
mauled
He
stood
where
he
had
arisen
opened
his
mouth
and
broke
out
the
long
heartbroken
puppy
wail
But
even
this
he
was
not
allowed
to
complete
In
the
middle
of
it
White
Fang
rushing
in
sank
his
teeth
into
Liplip’s
hind
leg
There
was
no
fight
left
in
Liplip
and
he
ran
away
shamelessly
his
victim
hot
on
his
heels
and
worrying
him
all
the
way
back
to
his
own
tepee
Here
the
squaws
came
to
his
aid
and
White
Fang
transformed
into
a
raging
demon
was
finally
driven
off
only
by
a
fusillade
of
stones
Came
the
day
when
Grey
Beaver
deciding
that
the
liability
of
her
running
away
was
past
released
Kiche
White
Fang
was
delighted
with
his
mother’s
freedom
He
accompanied
her
joyfully
about
the
camp
and
so
long
as
he
remained
close
by
her
side
Liplip
kept
a
respectful
distance
WhiteFang
even
bristled
up
to
him
and
walked
stifflegged
but
Liplip
ignored
the
challenge
He
was
no
fool
himself
and
whatever
vengeance
he
desired
to
wreak
he
could
wait
until
he
caught
White
Fang
alone
Later
on
that
day
Kiche
and
White
Fang
strayed
into
the
edge
of
the
woods
next
to
the
camp
He
had
led
his
mother
there
step
by
step
and
now
when
she
stopped
he
tried
to
inveigle
her
farther
The
stream
the
lair
and
the
quiet
woods
were
calling
to
him
and
he
wanted
her
to
come
He
ran
on
a
few
steps
stopped
and
looked
back
She
had
not
moved
He
whined
pleadingly
and
scurried
playfully
in
and
out
of
the
underbrush
He
ran
back
to
her
licked
her
face
and
ran
on
again
And
still
she
did
not
move
He
stopped
and
regarded
her
all
of
an
intentness
and
eagerness
physically
expressed
that
slowly
faded
out
of
him
as
she
turned
her
head
and
gazed
back
at
the
camp
There
was
something
calling
to
him
out
there
in
the
open
His
mother
heard
it
too
But
she
heard
also
that
other
and
louder
call
the
call
of
the
fire
and
of
man—the
call
which
has
been
given
alone
of
all
animals
to
the
wolf
to
answer
to
the
wolf
and
the
wilddog
who
are
brothers
Kiche
turned
and
slowly
trotted
back
toward
camp
Stronger
than
the
physical
restraint
of
the
stick
was
the
clutch
of
the
camp
upon
her
Unseen
and
occultly
the
gods
still
gripped
with
their
power
and
would
not
let
her
go
White
Fang
sat
down
in
the
shadow
of
a
birch
and
whimpered
softly
There
was
a
strong
smell
of
pine
and
subtle
wood
fragrances
filled
the
air
reminding
him
of
his
old
life
of
freedom
before
the
days
of
his
bondage
But
he
was
still
only
a
partgrown
puppy
and
stronger
than
the
call
either
of
man
or
of
the
Wild
was
the
call
of
his
mother
All
the
hours
of
his
short
life
he
had
depended
upon
her
The
time
was
yet
to
come
for
independence
So
he
arose
and
trotted
forlornly
back
to
camp
pausing
once
and
twice
to
sit
down
and
whimper
and
to
listen
to
the
call
that
still
sounded
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
In
the
Wild
the
time
of
a
mother
with
her
young
is
short
but
under
the
dominion
of
man
it
is
sometimes
even
shorter
Thus
it
was
with
White
Fang
Grey
Beaver
was
in
the
debt
of
Three
Eagles
Three
Eagles
was
going
away
on
a
trip
up
the
Mackenzie
to
the
Great
Slave
Lake
A
strip
of
scarlet
cloth
a
bearskin
twenty
cartridges
and
Kiche
went
to
pay
the
debt
White
Fang
saw
his
mother
taken
aboard
Three
Eagles’
canoe
and
tried
to
follow
her
A
blow
from
Three
Eagles
knocked
him
backward
to
the
land
The
canoe
shoved
off
He
sprang
into
the
water
and
swam
after
it
deaf
to
the
sharp
cries
of
Grey
Beaver
to
return
Even
a
mananimal
a
god
White
Fang
ignored
such
was
the
terror
he
was
in
of
losing
his
mother
But
gods
are
accustomed
to
being
obeyed
and
Grey
Beaver
wrathfully
launched
a
canoe
in
pursuit
When
he
overtook
White
Fang
he
reached
down
and
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
lifted
him
clear
of
the
water
He
did
not
deposit
him
at
once
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
Holding
him
suspended
with
one
hand
with
the
other
hand
he
proceeded
to
give
him
a
beating
And
it
was
a
beating
His
hand
was
heavy
Every
blow
was
shrewd
to
hurt
and
he
delivered
a
multitude
of
blows
Impelled
by
the
blows
that
rained
upon
him
now
from
this
side
now
from
that
White
Fang
swung
back
and
forth
like
an
erratic
and
jerky
pendulum
Varying
were
the
emotions
that
surged
through
him
At
first
he
had
known
surprise
Then
came
a
momentary
fear
when
he
yelped
several
times
to
the
impact
of
the
hand
But
this
was
quickly
followed
by
anger
His
free
nature
asserted
itself
and
he
showed
his
teeth
and
snarled
fearlessly
in
the
face
of
the
wrathful
god
This
but
served
to
make
the
god
more
wrathful
The
blows
came
faster
heavier
more
shrewd
to
hurt
Grey
Beaver
continued
to
beat
White
Fang
continued
to
snarl
But
this
could
not
last
for
ever
One
or
the
other
must
give
over
and
that
one
was
White
Fang
Fear
surged
through
him
again
For
the
first
time
he
was
being
really
manhandled
The
occasional
blows
of
sticks
and
stones
he
had
previously
experienced
were
as
caresses
compared
with
this
He
broke
down
and
began
to
cry
and
yelp
For
a
time
each
blow
brought
a
yelp
from
him
but
fear
passed
into
terror
until
finally
his
yelps
were
voiced
in
unbroken
succession
unconnected
with
the
rhythm
of
the
punishment
At
last
Grey
Beaver
withheld
his
hand
White
Fang
hanging
limply
continued
to
cry
This
seemed
to
satisfy
his
master
who
flung
him
down
roughly
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
In
the
meantime
the
canoe
had
drifted
down
the
stream
Grey
Beaver
picked
up
the
paddle
White
Fang
was
in
his
way
He
spurned
him
savagely
with
his
foot
In
that
moment
White
Fang’s
free
nature
flashed
forth
again
and
he
sank
his
teeth
into
the
moccasined
foot
The
beating
that
had
gone
before
was
as
nothing
compared
with
the
beating
he
now
received
Grey
Beaver’s
wrath
was
terrible
likewise
was
White
Fang’s
fright
Not
only
the
hand
but
the
hard
wooden
paddle
was
used
upon
him
and
he
was
bruised
and
sore
in
all
his
small
body
when
he
was
again
flung
down
in
the
canoe
Again
and
this
time
with
purpose
did
Grey
Beaver
kick
him
White
Fang
did
not
repeat
his
attack
on
the
foot
He
had
learned
another
lesson
of
his
bondage
Never
no
matter
what
the
circumstance
must
he
dare
to
bite
the
god
who
was
lord
and
master
over
him
the
body
of
the
lord
and
master
was
sacred
not
to
be
defiled
by
the
teeth
of
such
as
he
That
was
evidently
the
crime
of
crimes
the
one
offence
there
was
no
condoning
nor
overlooking
When
the
canoe
touched
the
shore
White
Fang
lay
whimpering
and
motionless
waiting
the
will
of
Grey
Beaver
It
was
Grey
Beaver’s
will
that
he
should
go
ashore
for
ashore
he
was
flung
striking
heavily
on
his
side
and
hurting
his
bruises
afresh
He
crawled
tremblingly
to
his
feet
and
stood
whimpering
Liplip
who
had
watched
the
whole
proceeding
from
the
bank
now
rushed
upon
him
knocking
him
over
and
sinking
his
teeth
into
him
White
Fang
was
too
helpless
to
defend
himself
and
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
him
had
not
Grey
Beaver’s
foot
shot
out
lifting
Liplip
into
the
air
with
its
violence
so
that
he
smashed
down
to
earth
a
dozen
feet
away
This
was
the
mananimal’s
justice
and
even
then
in
his
own
pitiable
plight
White
Fang
experienced
a
little
grateful
thrill
At
Grey
Beaver’s
heels
he
limped
obediently
through
the
village
to
the
tepee
And
so
it
came
that
White
Fang
learned
that
the
right
to
punish
was
something
the
gods
reserved
for
themselves
and
denied
to
the
lesser
creatures
under
them
That
night
when
all
was
still
White
Fang
remembered
his
mother
and
sorrowed
for
her
He
sorrowed
too
loudly
and
woke
up
Grey
Beaver
who
beat
him
After
that
he
mourned
gently
when
the
gods
were
around
But
sometimes
straying
off
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
by
himself
he
gave
vent
to
his
grief
and
cried
it
out
with
loud
whimperings
and
wailings
It
was
during
this
period
that
he
might
have
harkened
to
the
memories
of
the
lair
and
the
stream
and
run
back
to
the
Wild
But
the
memory
of
his
mother
held
him
As
the
hunting
mananimals
went
out
and
came
back
so
she
would
come
back
to
the
village
some
time
So
he
remained
in
his
bondage
waiting
for
her
But
it
was
not
altogether
an
unhappy
bondage
There
was
much
to
interest
him
Something
was
always
happening
There
was
no
end
to
the
strange
things
these
gods
did
and
he
was
always
curious
to
see
Besides
he
was
learning
how
to
get
along
with
Grey
Beaver
Obedience
rigid
undeviating
obedience
was
what
was
exacted
of
him
and
in
return
he
escaped
beatings
and
his
existence
was
tolerated
Nay
Grey
Beaver
himself
sometimes
tossed
him
a
piece
of
meat
and
defended
him
against
the
other
dogs
in
the
eating
of
it
And
such
a
piece
of
meat
was
of
value
It
was
worth
more
in
some
strange
way
then
a
dozen
pieces
of
meat
from
the
hand
of
a
squaw
Grey
Beaver
never
petted
nor
caressed
Perhaps
it
was
the
weight
of
his
hand
perhaps
his
justice
perhaps
the
sheer
power
of
him
and
perhaps
it
was
all
these
things
that
influenced
White
Fang
for
a
certain
tie
of
attachment
was
forming
between
him
and
his
surly
lord
Insidiously
and
by
remote
ways
as
well
as
by
the
power
of
stick
and
stone
and
clout
of
hand
were
the
shackles
of
White
Fang’s
bondage
being
riveted
upon
him
The
qualities
in
his
kind
that
in
the
beginning
made
it
possible
for
them
to
come
in
to
the
fires
of
men
were
qualities
capable
of
development
They
were
developing
in
him
and
the
camplife
replete
with
misery
as
it
was
was
secretly
endearing
itself
to
him
all
the
time
But
White
Fang
was
unaware
of
it
He
knew
only
grief
for
the
loss
of
Kiche
hope
for
her
return
and
a
hungry
yearning
for
the
free
life
that
had
been
his
CHAPTER
III
THE
OUTCAST
Liplip
continued
so
to
darken
his
days
that
White
Fang
became
wickeder
and
more
ferocious
than
it
was
his
natural
right
to
be
Savageness
was
a
part
of
his
makeup
but
the
savageness
thus
developed
exceeded
his
makeup
He
acquired
a
reputation
for
wickedness
amongst
the
mananimals
themselves
Wherever
there
was
trouble
and
uproar
in
camp
fighting
and
squabbling
or
the
outcry
of
a
squaw
over
a
bit
of
stolen
meat
they
were
sure
to
find
White
Fang
mixed
up
in
it
and
usually
at
the
bottom
of
it
They
did
not
bother
to
look
after
the
causes
of
his
conduct
They
saw
only
the
effects
and
the
effects
were
bad
He
was
a
sneak
and
a
thief
a
mischiefmaker
a
fomenter
of
trouble
and
irate
squaws
told
him
to
his
face
the
while
he
eyed
them
alert
and
ready
to
dodge
any
quickflung
missile
that
he
was
a
wolf
and
worthless
and
bound
to
come
to
an
evil
end
He
found
himself
an
outcast
in
the
midst
of
the
populous
camp
All
the
young
dogs
followed
Liplip’s
lead
There
was
a
difference
between
White
Fang
and
them
Perhaps
they
sensed
his
wildwood
breed
and
instinctively
felt
for
him
the
enmity
that
the
domestic
dog
feels
for
the
wolf
But
be
that
as
it
may
they
joined
with
Liplip
in
the
persecution
And
once
declared
against
him
they
found
good
reason
to
continue
declared
against
him
One
and
all
from
time
to
time
they
felt
his
teeth
and
to
his
credit
he
gave
more
than
he
received
Many
of
them
he
could
whip
in
single
fight
but
single
fight
was
denied
him
The
beginning
of
such
a
fight
was
a
signal
for
all
the
young
dogs
in
camp
to
come
running
and
pitch
upon
him
Out
of
this
packpersecution
he
learned
two
important
things
how
to
take
care
of
himself
in
a
massfight
against
him—and
how
on
a
single
dog
to
inflict
the
greatest
amount
of
damage
in
the
briefest
space
of
time
To
keep
one’s
feet
in
the
midst
of
the
hostile
mass
meant
life
and
this
he
learnt
well
He
became
catlike
in
his
ability
to
stay
on
his
feet
Even
grown
dogs
might
hurtle
him
backward
or
sideways
with
the
impact
of
their
heavy
bodies
and
backward
or
sideways
he
would
go
in
the
air
or
sliding
on
the
ground
but
always
with
his
legs
under
him
and
his
feet
downward
to
the
mother
earth
When
dogs
fight
there
are
usually
preliminaries
to
the
actual
combat—snarlings
and
bristlings
and
stifflegged
struttings
But
White
Fang
learned
to
omit
these
preliminaries
Delay
meant
the
coming
against
him
of
all
the
young
dogs
He
must
do
his
work
quickly
and
get
away
So
he
learnt
to
give
no
warning
of
his
intention
He
rushed
in
and
snapped
and
slashed
on
the
instant
without
notice
before
his
foe
could
prepare
to
meet
him
Thus
he
learned
how
to
inflict
quick
and
severe
damage
Also
he
learned
the
value
of
surprise
A
dog
taken
off
its
guard
its
shoulder
slashed
open
or
its
ear
ripped
in
ribbons
before
it
knew
what
was
happening
was
a
dog
half
whipped
Furthermore
it
was
remarkably
easy
to
overthrow
a
dog
taken
by
surprise
while
a
dog
thus
overthrown
invariably
exposed
for
a
moment
the
soft
underside
of
its
neck—the
vulnerable
point
at
which
to
strike
for
its
life
White
Fang
knew
this
point
It
was
a
knowledge
bequeathed
to
him
directly
from
the
hunting
generation
of
wolves
So
it
was
that
White
Fang’s
method
when
he
took
the
offensive
was
first
to
find
a
young
dog
alone
second
to
surprise
it
and
knock
it
off
its
feet
and
third
to
drive
in
with
his
teeth
at
the
soft
throat
Being
but
partly
grown
his
jaws
had
not
yet
become
large
enough
nor
strong
enough
to
make
his
throatattack
deadly
but
many
a
young
dog
went
around
camp
with
a
lacerated
throat
in
token
of
White
Fang’s
intention
And
one
day
catching
one
of
his
enemies
alone
on
the
edge
of
the
woods
he
managed
by
repeatedly
overthrowing
him
and
attacking
the
throat
to
cut
the
great
vein
and
let
out
the
life
There
was
a
great
row
that
night
He
had
been
observed
the
news
had
been
carried
to
the
dead
dog’s
master
the
squaws
remembered
all
the
instances
of
stolen
meat
and
Grey
Beaver
was
beset
by
many
angry
voices
But
he
resolutely
held
the
door
of
his
tepee
inside
which
he
had
placed
the
culprit
and
refused
to
permit
the
vengeance
for
which
his
tribespeople
clamoured
White
Fang
became
hated
by
man
and
dog
During
this
period
of
his
development
he
never
knew
a
moment’s
security
The
tooth
of
every
dog
was
against
him
the
hand
of
every
man
He
was
greeted
with
snarls
by
his
kind
with
curses
and
stones
by
his
gods
He
lived
tensely
He
was
always
keyed
up
alert
for
attack
wary
of
being
attacked
with
an
eye
for
sudden
and
unexpected
missiles
prepared
to
act
precipitately
and
coolly
to
leap
in
with
a
flash
of
teeth
or
to
leap
away
with
a
menacing
snarl
As
for
snarling
he
could
snarl
more
terribly
than
any
dog
young
or
old
in
camp
The
intent
of
the
snarl
is
to
warn
or
frighten
and
judgment
is
required
to
know
when
it
should
be
used
White
Fang
knew
how
to
make
it
and
when
to
make
it
Into
his
snarl
he
incorporated
all
that
was
vicious
malignant
and
horrible
With
nose
serrulated
by
continuous
spasms
hair
bristling
in
recurrent
waves
tongue
whipping
out
like
a
red
snake
and
whipping
back
again
ears
flattened
down
eyes
gleaming
hatred
lips
wrinkled
back
and
fangs
exposed
and
dripping
he
could
compel
a
pause
on
the
part
of
almost
any
assailant
A
temporary
pause
when
taken
off
his
guard
gave
him
the
vital
moment
in
which
to
think
and
determine
his
action
But
often
a
pause
so
gained
lengthened
out
until
it
evolved
into
a
complete
cessation
from
the
attack
And
before
more
than
one
of
the
grown
dogs
White
Fang’s
snarl
enabled
him
to
beat
an
honourable
retreat
An
outcast
himself
from
the
pack
of
the
partgrown
dogs
his
sanguinary
methods
and
remarkable
efficiency
made
the
pack
pay
for
its
persecution
of
him
Not
permitted
himself
to
run
with
the
pack
the
curious
state
of
affairs
obtained
that
no
member
of
the
pack
could
run
outside
the
pack
White
Fang
would
not
permit
it
What
of
his
bushwhacking
and
waylaying
tactics
the
young
dogs
were
afraid
to
run
by
themselves
With
the
exception
of
Liplip
they
were
compelled
to
hunch
together
for
mutual
protection
against
the
terrible
enemy
they
had
made
A
puppy
alone
by
the
river
bank
meant
a
puppy
dead
or
a
puppy
that
aroused
the
camp
with
its
shrill
pain
and
terror
as
it
fled
back
from
the
wolfcub
that
had
waylaid
it
But
White
Fang’s
reprisals
did
not
cease
even
when
the
young
dogs
had
learned
thoroughly
that
they
must
stay
together
He
attacked
them
when
he
caught
them
alone
and
they
attacked
him
when
they
were
bunched
The
sight
of
him
was
sufficient
to
start
them
rushing
after
him
at
which
times
his
swiftness
usually
carried
him
into
safety
But
woe
the
dog
that
outran
his
fellows
in
such
pursuit
White
Fang
had
learned
to
turn
suddenly
upon
the
pursuer
that
was
ahead
of
the
pack
and
thoroughly
to
rip
him
up
before
the
pack
could
arrive
This
occurred
with
great
frequency
for
once
in
full
cry
the
dogs
were
prone
to
forget
themselves
in
the
excitement
of
the
chase
while
White
Fang
never
forgot
himself
Stealing
backward
glances
as
he
ran
he
was
always
ready
to
whirl
around
and
down
the
overzealous
pursuer
that
outran
his
fellows
Young
dogs
are
bound
to
play
and
out
of
the
exigencies
of
the
situation
they
realised
their
play
in
this
mimic
warfare
Thus
it
was
that
the
hunt
of
White
Fang
became
their
chief
game—a
deadly
game
withal
and
at
all
times
a
serious
game
He
on
the
other
hand
being
the
fastestfooted
was
unafraid
to
venture
anywhere
During
the
period
that
he
waited
vainly
for
his
mother
to
come
back
he
led
the
pack
many
a
wild
chase
through
the
adjacent
woods
But
the
pack
invariably
lost
him
Its
noise
and
outcry
warned
him
of
its
presence
while
he
ran
alone
velvetfooted
silently
a
moving
shadow
among
the
trees
after
the
manner
of
his
father
and
mother
before
him
Further
he
was
more
directly
connected
with
the
Wild
than
they
and
he
knew
more
of
its
secrets
and
stratagems
A
favourite
trick
of
his
was
to
lose
his
trail
in
running
water
and
then
lie
quietly
in
a
nearby
thicket
while
their
baffled
cries
arose
around
him
Hated
by
his
kind
and
by
mankind
indomitable
perpetually
warred
upon
and
himself
waging
perpetual
war
his
development
was
rapid
and
onesided
This
was
no
soil
for
kindliness
and
affection
to
blossom
in
Of
such
things
he
had
not
the
faintest
glimmering
The
code
he
learned
was
to
obey
the
strong
and
to
oppress
the
weak
Grey
Beaver
was
a
god
and
strong
Therefore
White
Fang
obeyed
him
But
the
dog
younger
or
smaller
than
himself
was
weak
a
thing
to
be
destroyed
His
development
was
in
the
direction
of
power
In
order
to
face
the
constant
danger
of
hurt
and
even
of
destruction
his
predatory
and
protective
faculties
were
unduly
developed
He
became
quicker
of
movement
than
the
other
dogs
swifter
of
foot
craftier
deadlier
more
lithe
more
lean
with
ironlike
muscle
and
sinew
more
enduring
more
cruel
more
ferocious
and
more
intelligent
He
had
to
become
all
these
things
else
he
would
not
have
held
his
own
nor
survive
the
hostile
environment
in
which
he
found
himself
CHAPTER
IV
THE
TRAIL
OF
THE
GODS
In
the
fall
of
the
year
when
the
days
were
shortening
and
the
bite
of
the
frost
was
coming
into
the
air
White
Fang
got
his
chance
for
liberty
For
several
days
there
had
been
a
great
hubbub
in
the
village
The
summer
camp
was
being
dismantled
and
the
tribe
bag
and
baggage
was
preparing
to
go
off
to
the
fall
hunting
White
Fang
watched
it
all
with
eager
eyes
and
when
the
tepees
began
to
come
down
and
the
canoes
were
loading
at
the
bank
he
understood
Already
the
canoes
were
departing
and
some
had
disappeared
down
the
river
Quite
deliberately
he
determined
to
stay
behind
He
waited
his
opportunity
to
slink
out
of
camp
to
the
woods
Here
in
the
running
stream
where
ice
was
beginning
to
form
he
hid
his
trail
Then
he
crawled
into
the
heart
of
a
dense
thicket
and
waited
The
time
passed
by
and
he
slept
intermittently
for
hours
Then
he
was
aroused
by
Grey
Beaver’s
voice
calling
him
by
name
There
were
other
voices
White
Fang
could
hear
Grey
Beaver’s
squaw
taking
part
in
the
search
and
Mitsah
who
was
Grey
Beaver’s
son
White
Fang
trembled
with
fear
and
though
the
impulse
came
to
crawl
out
of
his
hidingplace
he
resisted
it
After
a
time
the
voices
died
away
and
some
time
after
that
he
crept
out
to
enjoy
the
success
of
his
undertaking
Darkness
was
coming
on
and
for
a
while
he
played
about
among
the
trees
pleasuring
in
his
freedom
Then
and
quite
suddenly
he
became
aware
of
loneliness
He
sat
down
to
consider
listening
to
the
silence
of
the
forest
and
perturbed
by
it
That
nothing
moved
nor
sounded
seemed
ominous
He
felt
the
lurking
of
danger
unseen
and
unguessed
He
was
suspicious
of
the
looming
bulks
of
the
trees
and
of
the
dark
shadows
that
might
conceal
all
manner
of
perilous
things
Then
it
was
cold
Here
was
no
warm
side
of
a
tepee
against
which
to
snuggle
The
frost
was
in
his
feet
and
he
kept
lifting
first
one
forefoot
and
then
the
other
He
curved
his
bushy
tail
around
to
cover
them
and
at
the
same
time
he
saw
a
vision
There
was
nothing
strange
about
it
Upon
his
inward
sight
was
impressed
a
succession
of
memorypictures
He
saw
the
camp
again
the
tepees
and
the
blaze
of
the
fires
He
heard
the
shrill
voices
of
the
women
the
gruff
basses
of
the
men
and
the
snarling
of
the
dogs
He
was
hungry
and
he
remembered
pieces
of
meat
and
fish
that
had
been
thrown
him
Here
was
no
meat
nothing
but
a
threatening
and
inedible
silence
His
bondage
had
softened
him
Irresponsibility
had
weakened
him
He
had
forgotten
how
to
shift
for
himself
The
night
yawned
about
him
His
senses
accustomed
to
the
hum
and
bustle
of
the
camp
used
to
the
continuous
impact
of
sights
and
sounds
were
now
left
idle
There
was
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
see
nor
hear
They
strained
to
catch
some
interruption
of
the
silence
and
immobility
of
nature
They
were
appalled
by
inaction
and
by
the
feel
of
something
terrible
impending
He
gave
a
great
start
of
fright
A
colossal
and
formless
something
was
rushing
across
the
field
of
his
vision
It
was
a
treeshadow
flung
by
the
moon
from
whose
face
the
clouds
had
been
brushed
away
Reassured
he
whimpered
softly
then
he
suppressed
the
whimper
for
fear
that
it
might
attract
the
attention
of
the
lurking
dangers
A
tree
contracting
in
the
cool
of
the
night
made
a
loud
noise
It
was
directly
above
him
He
yelped
in
his
fright
A
panic
seized
him
and
he
ran
madly
toward
the
village
He
knew
an
overpowering
desire
for
the
protection
and
companionship
of
man
In
his
nostrils
was
the
smell
of
the
campsmoke
In
his
ears
the
campsounds
and
cries
were
ringing
loud
He
passed
out
of
the
forest
and
into
the
moonlit
open
where
were
no
shadows
nor
darknesses
But
no
village
greeted
his
eyes
He
had
forgotten
The
village
had
gone
away
His
wild
flight
ceased
abruptly
There
was
no
place
to
which
to
flee
He
slunk
forlornly
through
the
deserted
camp
smelling
the
rubbishheaps
and
the
discarded
rags
and
tags
of
the
gods
He
would
have
been
glad
for
the
rattle
of
stones
about
him
flung
by
an
angry
squaw
glad
for
the
hand
of
Grey
Beaver
descending
upon
him
in
wrath
while
he
would
have
welcomed
with
delight
Liplip
and
the
whole
snarling
cowardly
pack
He
came
to
where
Grey
Beaver’s
tepee
had
stood
In
the
centre
of
the
space
it
had
occupied
he
sat
down
He
pointed
his
nose
at
the
moon
His
throat
was
afflicted
by
rigid
spasms
his
mouth
opened
and
in
a
heartbroken
cry
bubbled
up
his
loneliness
and
fear
his
grief
for
Kiche
all
his
past
sorrows
and
miseries
as
well
as
his
apprehension
of
sufferings
and
dangers
to
come
It
was
the
long
wolfhowl
fullthroated
and
mournful
the
first
howl
he
had
ever
uttered
The
coming
of
daylight
dispelled
his
fears
but
increased
his
loneliness
The
naked
earth
which
so
shortly
before
had
been
so
populous
thrust
his
loneliness
more
forcibly
upon
him
It
did
not
take
him
long
to
make
up
his
mind
He
plunged
into
the
forest
and
followed
the
river
bank
down
the
stream
All
day
he
ran
He
did
not
rest
He
seemed
made
to
run
on
for
ever
His
ironlike
body
ignored
fatigue
And
even
after
fatigue
came
his
heritage
of
endurance
braced
him
to
endless
endeavour
and
enabled
him
to
drive
his
complaining
body
onward
Where
the
river
swung
in
against
precipitous
bluffs
he
climbed
the
high
mountains
behind
Rivers
and
streams
that
entered
the
main
river
he
forded
or
swam
Often
he
took
to
the
rimice
that
was
beginning
to
form
and
more
than
once
he
crashed
through
and
struggled
for
life
in
the
icy
current
Always
he
was
on
the
lookout
for
the
trail
of
the
gods
where
it
might
leave
the
river
and
proceed
inland
White
Fang
was
intelligent
beyond
the
average
of
his
kind
yet
his
mental
vision
was
not
wide
enough
to
embrace
the
other
bank
of
the
Mackenzie
What
if
the
trail
of
the
gods
led
out
on
that
side
It
never
entered
his
head
Later
on
when
he
had
travelled
more
and
grown
older
and
wiser
and
come
to
know
more
of
trails
and
rivers
it
might
be
that
he
could
grasp
and
apprehend
such
a
possibility
But
that
mental
power
was
yet
in
the
future
Just
now
he
ran
blindly
his
own
bank
of
the
Mackenzie
alone
entering
into
his
calculations
All
night
he
ran
blundering
in
the
darkness
into
mishaps
and
obstacles
that
delayed
but
did
not
daunt
By
the
middle
of
the
second
day
he
had
been
running
continuously
for
thirty
hours
and
the
iron
of
his
flesh
was
giving
out
It
was
the
endurance
of
his
mind
that
kept
him
going
He
had
not
eaten
in
forty
hours
and
he
was
weak
with
hunger
The
repeated
drenchings
in
the
icy
water
had
likewise
had
their
effect
on
him
His
handsome
coat
was
draggled
The
broad
pads
of
his
feet
were
bruised
and
bleeding
He
had
begun
to
limp
and
this
limp
increased
with
the
hours
To
make
it
worse
the
light
of
the
sky
was
obscured
and
snow
began
to
fall—a
raw
moist
melting
clinging
snow
slippery
under
foot
that
hid
from
him
the
landscape
he
traversed
and
that
covered
over
the
inequalities
of
the
ground
so
that
the
way
of
his
feet
was
more
difficult
and
painful
Grey
Beaver
had
intended
camping
that
night
on
the
far
bank
of
the
Mackenzie
for
it
was
in
that
direction
that
the
hunting
lay
But
on
the
near
bank
shortly
before
dark
a
moose
coming
down
to
drink
had
been
espied
by
Klookooch
who
was
Grey
Beaver’s
squaw
Now
had
not
the
moose
come
down
to
drink
had
not
Mitsah
been
steering
out
of
the
course
because
of
the
snow
had
not
Klookooch
sighted
the
moose
and
had
not
Grey
Beaver
killed
it
with
a
lucky
shot
from
his
rifle
all
subsequent
things
would
have
happened
differently
Grey
Beaver
would
not
have
camped
on
the
near
side
of
the
Mackenzie
and
White
Fang
would
have
passed
by
and
gone
on
either
to
die
or
to
find
his
way
to
his
wild
brothers
and
become
one
of
them—a
wolf
to
the
end
of
his
days
Night
had
fallen
The
snow
was
flying
more
thickly
and
White
Fang
whimpering
softly
to
himself
as
he
stumbled
and
limped
along
came
upon
a
fresh
trail
in
the
snow
So
fresh
was
it
that
he
knew
it
immediately
for
what
it
was
Whining
with
eagerness
he
followed
back
from
the
river
bank
and
in
among
the
trees
The
campsounds
came
to
his
ears
He
saw
the
blaze
of
the
fire
Klookooch
cooking
and
Grey
Beaver
squatting
on
his
hams
and
mumbling
a
chunk
of
raw
tallow
There
was
fresh
meat
in
camp
White
Fang
expected
a
beating
He
crouched
and
bristled
a
little
at
the
thought
of
it
Then
he
went
forward
again
He
feared
and
disliked
the
beating
he
knew
to
be
waiting
for
him
But
he
knew
further
that
the
comfort
of
the
fire
would
be
his
the
protection
of
the
gods
the
companionship
of
the
dogs—the
last
a
companionship
of
enmity
but
none
the
less
a
companionship
and
satisfying
to
his
gregarious
needs
He
came
cringing
and
crawling
into
the
firelight
Grey
Beaver
saw
him
and
stopped
munching
the
tallow
White
Fang
crawled
slowly
cringing
and
grovelling
in
the
abjectness
of
his
abasement
and
submission
He
crawled
straight
toward
Grey
Beaver
every
inch
of
his
progress
becoming
slower
and
more
painful
At
last
he
lay
at
the
master’s
feet
into
whose
possession
he
now
surrendered
himself
voluntarily
body
and
soul
Of
his
own
choice
he
came
in
to
sit
by
man’s
fire
and
to
be
ruled
by
him
White
Fang
trembled
waiting
for
the
punishment
to
fall
upon
him
There
was
a
movement
of
the
hand
above
him
He
cringed
involuntarily
under
the
expected
blow
It
did
not
fall
He
stole
a
glance
upward
Grey
Beaver
was
breaking
the
lump
of
tallow
in
half
Grey
Beaver
was
offering
him
one
piece
of
the
tallow
Very
gently
and
somewhat
suspiciously
he
first
smelled
the
tallow
and
then
proceeded
to
eat
it
Grey
Beaver
ordered
meat
to
be
brought
to
him
and
guarded
him
from
the
other
dogs
while
he
ate
After
that
grateful
and
content
White
Fang
lay
at
Grey
Beaver’s
feet
gazing
at
the
fire
that
warmed
him
blinking
and
dozing
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
the
morrow
would
find
him
not
wandering
forlorn
through
bleak
foreststretches
but
in
the
camp
of
the
mananimals
with
the
gods
to
whom
he
had
given
himself
and
upon
whom
he
was
now
dependent
CHAPTER
V
THE
COVENANT
When
December
was
well
along
Grey
Beaver
went
on
a
journey
up
the
Mackenzie
Mitsah
and
Klookooch
went
with
him
One
sled
he
drove
himself
drawn
by
dogs
he
had
traded
for
or
borrowed
A
second
and
smaller
sled
was
driven
by
Mitsah
and
to
this
was
harnessed
a
team
of
puppies
It
was
more
of
a
toy
affair
than
anything
else
yet
it
was
the
delight
of
Mitsah
who
felt
that
he
was
beginning
to
do
a
man’s
work
in
the
world
Also
he
was
learning
to
drive
dogs
and
to
train
dogs
while
the
puppies
themselves
were
being
broken
in
to
the
harness
Furthermore
the
sled
was
of
some
service
for
it
carried
nearly
two
hundred
pounds
of
outfit
and
food
White
Fang
had
seen
the
campdogs
toiling
in
the
harness
so
that
he
did
not
resent
overmuch
the
first
placing
of
the
harness
upon
himself
About
his
neck
was
put
a
mossstuffed
collar
which
was
connected
by
two
pullingtraces
to
a
strap
that
passed
around
his
chest
and
over
his
back
It
was
to
this
that
was
fastened
the
long
rope
by
which
he
pulled
at
the
sled
There
were
seven
puppies
in
the
team
The
others
had
been
born
earlier
in
the
year
and
were
nine
and
ten
months
old
while
White
Fang
was
only
eight
months
old
Each
dog
was
fastened
to
the
sled
by
a
single
rope
No
two
ropes
were
of
the
same
length
while
the
difference
in
length
between
any
two
ropes
was
at
least
that
of
a
dog’s
body
Every
rope
was
brought
to
a
ring
at
the
front
end
of
the
sled
The
sled
itself
was
without
runners
being
a
birchbark
toboggan
with
upturned
forward
end
to
keep
it
from
ploughing
under
the
snow
This
construction
enabled
the
weight
of
the
sled
and
load
to
be
distributed
over
the
largest
snowsurface
for
the
snow
was
crystalpowder
and
very
soft
Observing
the
same
principle
of
widest
distribution
of
weight
the
dogs
at
the
ends
of
their
ropes
radiated
fanfashion
from
the
nose
of
the
sled
so
that
no
dog
trod
in
another’s
footsteps
There
was
furthermore
another
virtue
in
the
fanformation
The
ropes
of
varying
length
prevented
the
dogs
attacking
from
the
rear
those
that
ran
in
front
of
them
For
a
dog
to
attack
another
it
would
have
to
turn
upon
one
at
a
shorter
rope
In
which
case
it
would
find
itself
face
to
face
with
the
dog
attacked
and
also
it
would
find
itself
facing
the
whip
of
the
driver
But
the
most
peculiar
virtue
of
all
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
dog
that
strove
to
attack
one
in
front
of
him
must
pull
the
sled
faster
and
that
the
faster
the
sled
travelled
the
faster
could
the
dog
attacked
run
away
Thus
the
dog
behind
could
never
catch
up
with
the
one
in
front
The
faster
he
ran
the
faster
ran
the
one
he
was
after
and
the
faster
ran
all
the
dogs
Incidentally
the
sled
went
faster
and
thus
by
cunning
indirection
did
man
increase
his
mastery
over
the
beasts
Mitsah
resembled
his
father
much
of
whose
grey
wisdom
he
possessed
In
the
past
he
had
observed
Liplip’s
persecution
of
White
Fang
but
at
that
time
Liplip
was
another
man’s
dog
and
Mitsah
had
never
dared
more
than
to
shy
an
occasional
stone
at
him
But
now
Liplip
was
his
dog
and
he
proceeded
to
wreak
his
vengeance
on
him
by
putting
him
at
the
end
of
the
longest
rope
This
made
Liplip
the
leader
and
was
apparently
an
honour
but
in
reality
it
took
away
from
him
all
honour
and
instead
of
being
bully
and
master
of
the
pack
he
now
found
himself
hated
and
persecuted
by
the
pack
Because
he
ran
at
the
end
of
the
longest
rope
the
dogs
had
always
the
view
of
him
running
away
before
them
All
that
they
saw
of
him
was
his
bushy
tail
and
fleeing
hind
legs—a
view
far
less
ferocious
and
intimidating
than
his
bristling
mane
and
gleaming
fangs
Also
dogs
being
so
constituted
in
their
mental
ways
the
sight
of
him
running
away
gave
desire
to
run
after
him
and
a
feeling
that
he
ran
away
from
them
The
moment
the
sled
started
the
team
took
after
Liplip
in
a
chase
that
extended
throughout
the
day
At
first
he
had
been
prone
to
turn
upon
his
pursuers
jealous
of
his
dignity
and
wrathful
but
at
such
times
Mitsah
would
throw
the
stinging
lash
of
the
thirtyfoot
cariboogut
whip
into
his
face
and
compel
him
to
turn
tail
and
run
on
Liplip
might
face
the
pack
but
he
could
not
face
that
whip
and
all
that
was
left
him
to
do
was
to
keep
his
long
rope
taut
and
his
flanks
ahead
of
the
teeth
of
his
mates
But
a
still
greater
cunning
lurked
in
the
recesses
of
the
Indian
mind
To
give
point
to
unending
pursuit
of
the
leader
Mitsah
favoured
him
over
the
other
dogs
These
favours
aroused
in
them
jealousy
and
hatred
In
their
presence
Mitsah
would
give
him
meat
and
would
give
it
to
him
only
This
was
maddening
to
them
They
would
rage
around
just
outside
the
throwingdistance
of
the
whip
while
Liplip
devoured
the
meat
and
Mitsah
protected
him
And
when
there
was
no
meat
to
give
Mitsah
would
keep
the
team
at
a
distance
and
make
believe
to
give
meat
to
Liplip
White
Fang
took
kindly
to
the
work
He
had
travelled
a
greater
distance
than
the
other
dogs
in
the
yielding
of
himself
to
the
rule
of
the
gods
and
he
had
learned
more
thoroughly
the
futility
of
opposing
their
will
In
addition
the
persecution
he
had
suffered
from
the
pack
had
made
the
pack
less
to
him
in
the
scheme
of
things
and
man
more
He
had
not
learned
to
be
dependent
on
his
kind
for
companionship
Besides
Kiche
was
wellnigh
forgotten
and
the
chief
outlet
of
expression
that
remained
to
him
was
in
the
allegiance
he
tendered
the
gods
he
had
accepted
as
masters
So
he
worked
hard
learned
discipline
and
was
obedient
Faithfulness
and
willingness
characterised
his
toil
These
are
essential
traits
of
the
wolf
and
the
wilddog
when
they
have
become
domesticated
and
these
traits
White
Fang
possessed
in
unusual
measure
A
companionship
did
exist
between
White
Fang
and
the
other
dogs
but
it
was
one
of
warfare
and
enmity
He
had
never
learned
to
play
with
them
He
knew
only
how
to
fight
and
fight
with
them
he
did
returning
to
them
a
hundredfold
the
snaps
and
slashes
they
had
given
him
in
the
days
when
Liplip
was
leader
of
the
pack
But
Liplip
was
no
longer
leader—except
when
he
fled
away
before
his
mates
at
the
end
of
his
rope
the
sled
bounding
along
behind
In
camp
he
kept
close
to
Mitsah
or
Grey
Beaver
or
Klookooch
He
did
not
dare
venture
away
from
the
gods
for
now
the
fangs
of
all
dogs
were
against
him
and
he
tasted
to
the
dregs
the
persecution
that
had
been
White
Fang’s
With
the
overthrow
of
Liplip
White
Fang
could
have
become
leader
of
the
pack
But
he
was
too
morose
and
solitary
for
that
He
merely
thrashed
his
teammates
Otherwise
he
ignored
them
They
got
out
of
his
way
when
he
came
along
nor
did
the
boldest
of
them
ever
dare
to
rob
him
of
his
meat
On
the
contrary
they
devoured
their
own
meat
hurriedly
for
fear
that
he
would
take
it
away
from
them
White
Fang
knew
the
law
well
to
oppress
the
weak
and
obey
the
strong
He
ate
his
share
of
meat
as
rapidly
as
he
could
And
then
woe
the
dog
that
had
not
yet
finished
A
snarl
and
a
flash
of
fangs
and
that
dog
would
wail
his
indignation
to
the
uncomforting
stars
while
White
Fang
finished
his
portion
for
him
Every
little
while
however
one
dog
or
another
would
flame
up
in
revolt
and
be
promptly
subdued
Thus
White
Fang
was
kept
in
training
He
was
jealous
of
the
isolation
in
which
he
kept
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
pack
and
he
fought
often
to
maintain
it
But
such
fights
were
of
brief
duration
He
was
too
quick
for
the
others
They
were
slashed
open
and
bleeding
before
they
knew
what
had
happened
were
whipped
almost
before
they
had
begun
to
fight
As
rigid
as
the
sleddiscipline
of
the
gods
was
the
discipline
maintained
by
White
Fang
amongst
his
fellows
He
never
allowed
them
any
latitude
He
compelled
them
to
an
unremitting
respect
for
him
They
might
do
as
they
pleased
amongst
themselves
That
was
no
concern
of
his
But
it
was
his
concern
that
they
leave
him
alone
in
his
isolation
get
out
of
his
way
when
he
elected
to
walk
among
them
and
at
all
times
acknowledge
his
mastery
over
them
A
hint
of
stiffleggedness
on
their
part
a
lifted
lip
or
a
bristle
of
hair
and
he
would
be
upon
them
merciless
and
cruel
swiftly
convincing
them
of
the
error
of
their
way
He
was
a
monstrous
tyrant
His
mastery
was
rigid
as
steel
He
oppressed
the
weak
with
a
vengeance
Not
for
nothing
had
he
been
exposed
to
the
pitiless
struggles
for
life
in
the
day
of
his
cubhood
when
his
mother
and
he
alone
and
unaided
held
their
own
and
survived
in
the
ferocious
environment
of
the
Wild
And
not
for
nothing
had
he
learned
to
walk
softly
when
superior
strength
went
by
He
oppressed
the
weak
but
he
respected
the
strong
And
in
the
course
of
the
long
journey
with
Grey
Beaver
he
walked
softly
indeed
amongst
the
fullgrown
dogs
in
the
camps
of
the
strange
mananimals
they
encountered
The
months
passed
by
Still
continued
the
journey
of
Grey
Beaver
White
Fang’s
strength
was
developed
by
the
long
hours
on
trail
and
the
steady
toil
at
the
sled
and
it
would
have
seemed
that
his
mental
development
was
wellnigh
complete
He
had
come
to
know
quite
thoroughly
the
world
in
which
he
lived
His
outlook
was
bleak
and
materialistic
The
world
as
he
saw
it
was
a
fierce
and
brutal
world
a
world
without
warmth
a
world
in
which
caresses
and
affection
and
the
bright
sweetnesses
of
the
spirit
did
not
exist
He
had
no
affection
for
Grey
Beaver
True
he
was
a
god
but
a
most
savage
god
White
Fang
was
glad
to
acknowledge
his
lordship
but
it
was
a
lordship
based
upon
superior
intelligence
and
brute
strength
There
was
something
in
the
fibre
of
White
Fang’s
being
that
made
his
lordship
a
thing
to
be
desired
else
he
would
not
have
come
back
from
the
Wild
when
he
did
to
tender
his
allegiance
There
were
deeps
in
his
nature
which
had
never
been
sounded
A
kind
word
a
caressing
touch
of
the
hand
on
the
part
of
Grey
Beaver
might
have
sounded
these
deeps
but
Grey
Beaver
did
not
caress
nor
speak
kind
words
It
was
not
his
way
His
primacy
was
savage
and
savagely
he
ruled
administering
justice
with
a
club
punishing
transgression
with
the
pain
of
a
blow
and
rewarding
merit
not
by
kindness
but
by
withholding
a
blow
So
White
Fang
knew
nothing
of
the
heaven
a
man’s
hand
might
contain
for
him
Besides
he
did
not
like
the
hands
of
the
mananimals
He
was
suspicious
of
them
It
was
true
that
they
sometimes
gave
meat
but
more
often
they
gave
hurt
Hands
were
things
to
keep
away
from
They
hurled
stones
wielded
sticks
and
clubs
and
whips
administered
slaps
and
clouts
and
when
they
touched
him
were
cunning
to
hurt
with
pinch
and
twist
and
wrench
In
strange
villages
he
had
encountered
the
hands
of
the
children
and
learned
that
they
were
cruel
to
hurt
Also
he
had
once
nearly
had
an
eye
poked
out
by
a
toddling
papoose
From
these
experiences
he
became
suspicious
of
all
children
He
could
not
tolerate
them
When
they
came
near
with
their
ominous
hands
he
got
up
It
was
in
a
village
at
the
Great
Slave
Lake
that
in
the
course
of
resenting
the
evil
of
the
hands
of
the
mananimals
he
came
to
modify
the
law
that
he
had
learned
from
Grey
Beaver
namely
that
the
unpardonable
crime
was
to
bite
one
of
the
gods
In
this
village
after
the
custom
of
all
dogs
in
all
villages
White
Fang
went
foraging
for
food
A
boy
was
chopping
frozen
moosemeat
with
an
axe
and
the
chips
were
flying
in
the
snow
White
Fang
sliding
by
in
quest
of
meat
stopped
and
began
to
eat
the
chips
He
observed
the
boy
lay
down
the
axe
and
take
up
a
stout
club
White
Fang
sprang
clear
just
in
time
to
escape
the
descending
blow
The
boy
pursued
him
and
he
a
stranger
in
the
village
fled
between
two
tepees
to
find
himself
cornered
against
a
high
earth
bank
There
was
no
escape
for
White
Fang
The
only
way
out
was
between
the
two
tepees
and
this
the
boy
guarded
Holding
his
club
prepared
to
strike
he
drew
in
on
his
cornered
quarry
White
Fang
was
furious
He
faced
the
boy
bristling
and
snarling
his
sense
of
justice
outraged
He
knew
the
law
of
forage
All
the
wastage
of
meat
such
as
the
frozen
chips
belonged
to
the
dog
that
found
it
He
had
done
no
wrong
broken
no
law
yet
here
was
this
boy
preparing
to
give
him
a
beating
White
Fang
scarcely
knew
what
happened
He
did
it
in
a
surge
of
rage
And
he
did
it
so
quickly
that
the
boy
did
not
know
either
All
the
boy
knew
was
that
he
had
in
some
unaccountable
way
been
overturned
into
the
snow
and
that
his
clubhand
had
been
ripped
wide
open
by
White
Fang’s
teeth
But
White
Fang
knew
that
he
had
broken
the
law
of
the
gods
He
had
driven
his
teeth
into
the
sacred
flesh
of
one
of
them
and
could
expect
nothing
but
a
most
terrible
punishment
He
fled
away
to
Grey
Beaver
behind
whose
protecting
legs
he
crouched
when
the
bitten
boy
and
the
boy’s
family
came
demanding
vengeance
But
they
went
away
with
vengeance
unsatisfied
Grey
Beaver
defended
White
Fang
So
did
Mitsah
and
Klookooch
White
Fang
listening
to
the
wordy
war
and
watching
the
angry
gestures
knew
that
his
act
was
justified
And
so
it
came
that
he
learned
there
were
gods
and
gods
There
were
his
gods
and
there
were
other
gods
and
between
them
there
was
a
difference
Justice
or
injustice
it
was
all
the
same
he
must
take
all
things
from
the
hands
of
his
own
gods
But
he
was
not
compelled
to
take
injustice
from
the
other
gods
It
was
his
privilege
to
resent
it
with
his
teeth
And
this
also
was
a
law
of
the
gods
Before
the
day
was
out
White
Fang
was
to
learn
more
about
this
law
Mitsah
alone
gathering
firewood
in
the
forest
encountered
the
boy
that
had
been
bitten
With
him
were
other
boys
Hot
words
passed
Then
all
the
boys
attacked
Mitsah
It
was
going
hard
with
him
Blows
were
raining
upon
him
from
all
sides
White
Fang
looked
on
at
first
This
was
an
affair
of
the
gods
and
no
concern
of
his
Then
he
realised
that
this
was
Mitsah
one
of
his
own
particular
gods
who
was
being
maltreated
It
was
no
reasoned
impulse
that
made
White
Fang
do
what
he
then
did
A
mad
rush
of
anger
sent
him
leaping
in
amongst
the
combatants
Five
minutes
later
the
landscape
was
covered
with
fleeing
boys
many
of
whom
dripped
blood
upon
the
snow
in
token
that
White
Fang’s
teeth
had
not
been
idle
When
Mitsah
told
the
story
in
camp
Grey
Beaver
ordered
meat
to
be
given
to
White
Fang
He
ordered
much
meat
to
be
given
and
White
Fang
gorged
and
sleepy
by
the
fire
knew
that
the
law
had
received
its
verification
It
was
in
line
with
these
experiences
that
White
Fang
came
to
learn
the
law
of
property
and
the
duty
of
the
defence
of
property
From
the
protection
of
his
god’s
body
to
the
protection
of
his
god’s
possessions
was
a
step
and
this
step
he
made
What
was
his
god’s
was
to
be
defended
against
all
the
world—even
to
the
extent
of
biting
other
gods
Not
only
was
such
an
act
sacrilegious
in
its
nature
but
it
was
fraught
with
peril
The
gods
were
allpowerful
and
a
dog
was
no
match
against
them
yet
White
Fang
learned
to
face
them
fiercely
belligerent
and
unafraid
Duty
rose
above
fear
and
thieving
gods
learned
to
leave
Grey
Beaver’s
property
alone
One
thing
in
this
connection
White
Fang
quickly
learnt
and
that
was
that
a
thieving
god
was
usually
a
cowardly
god
and
prone
to
run
away
at
the
sounding
of
the
alarm
Also
he
learned
that
but
brief
time
elapsed
between
his
sounding
of
the
alarm
and
Grey
Beaver
coming
to
his
aid
He
came
to
know
that
it
was
not
fear
of
him
that
drove
the
thief
away
but
fear
of
Grey
Beaver
White
Fang
did
not
give
the
alarm
by
barking
He
never
barked
His
method
was
to
drive
straight
at
the
intruder
and
to
sink
his
teeth
in
if
he
could
Because
he
was
morose
and
solitary
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
other
dogs
he
was
unusually
fitted
to
guard
his
master’s
property
and
in
this
he
was
encouraged
and
trained
by
Grey
Beaver
One
result
of
this
was
to
make
White
Fang
more
ferocious
and
indomitable
and
more
solitary
The
months
went
by
binding
stronger
and
stronger
the
covenant
between
dog
and
man
This
was
the
ancient
covenant
that
the
first
wolf
that
came
in
from
the
Wild
entered
into
with
man
And
like
all
succeeding
wolves
and
wild
dogs
that
had
done
likewise
White
Fang
worked
the
covenant
out
for
himself
The
terms
were
simple
For
the
possession
of
a
fleshandblood
god
he
exchanged
his
own
liberty
Food
and
fire
protection
and
companionship
were
some
of
the
things
he
received
from
the
god
In
return
he
guarded
the
god’s
property
defended
his
body
worked
for
him
and
obeyed
him
The
possession
of
a
god
implies
service
White
Fang’s
was
a
service
of
duty
and
awe
but
not
of
love
He
did
not
know
what
love
was
He
had
no
experience
of
love
Kiche
was
a
remote
memory
Besides
not
only
had
he
abandoned
the
Wild
and
his
kind
when
he
gave
himself
up
to
man
but
the
terms
of
the
covenant
were
such
that
if
ever
he
met
Kiche
again
he
would
not
desert
his
god
to
go
with
her
His
allegiance
to
man
seemed
somehow
a
law
of
his
being
greater
than
the
love
of
liberty
of
kind
and
kin
CHAPTER
VI
THE
FAMINE
The
spring
of
the
year
was
at
hand
when
Grey
Beaver
finished
his
long
journey
It
was
April
and
White
Fang
was
a
year
old
when
he
pulled
into
the
home
villages
and
was
loosed
from
the
harness
by
Mitsah
Though
a
long
way
from
his
full
growth
White
Fang
next
to
Liplip
was
the
largest
yearling
in
the
village
Both
from
his
father
the
wolf
and
from
Kiche
he
had
inherited
stature
and
strength
and
already
he
was
measuring
up
alongside
the
fullgrown
dogs
But
he
had
not
yet
grown
compact
His
body
was
slender
and
rangy
and
his
strength
more
stringy
than
massive
His
coat
was
the
true
wolfgrey
and
to
all
appearances
he
was
true
wolf
himself
The
quarterstrain
of
dog
he
had
inherited
from
Kiche
had
left
no
mark
on
him
physically
though
it
had
played
its
part
in
his
mental
makeup
He
wandered
through
the
village
recognising
with
staid
satisfaction
the
various
gods
he
had
known
before
the
long
journey
Then
there
were
the
dogs
puppies
growing
up
like
himself
and
grown
dogs
that
did
not
look
so
large
and
formidable
as
the
memory
pictures
he
retained
of
them
Also
he
stood
less
in
fear
of
them
than
formerly
stalking
among
them
with
a
certain
careless
ease
that
was
as
new
to
him
as
it
was
enjoyable
There
was
Baseek
a
grizzled
old
fellow
that
in
his
younger
days
had
but
to
uncover
his
fangs
to
send
White
Fang
cringing
and
crouching
to
the
right
about
From
him
White
Fang
had
learned
much
of
his
own
insignificance
and
from
him
he
was
now
to
learn
much
of
the
change
and
development
that
had
taken
place
in
himself
While
Baseek
had
been
growing
weaker
with
age
White
Fang
had
been
growing
stronger
with
youth
It
was
at
the
cuttingup
of
a
moose
freshkilled
that
White
Fang
learned
of
the
changed
relations
in
which
he
stood
to
the
dogworld
He
had
got
for
himself
a
hoof
and
part
of
the
shinbone
to
which
quite
a
bit
of
meat
was
attached
Withdrawn
from
the
immediate
scramble
of
the
other
dogs—in
fact
out
of
sight
behind
a
thicket—he
was
devouring
his
prize
when
Baseek
rushed
in
upon
him
Before
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
had
slashed
the
intruder
twice
and
sprung
clear
Baseek
was
surprised
by
the
other’s
temerity
and
swiftness
of
attack
He
stood
gazing
stupidly
across
at
White
Fang
the
raw
red
shinbone
between
them
Baseek
was
old
and
already
he
had
come
to
know
the
increasing
valour
of
the
dogs
it
had
been
his
wont
to
bully
Bitter
experiences
these
which
perforce
he
swallowed
calling
upon
all
his
wisdom
to
cope
with
them
In
the
old
days
he
would
have
sprung
upon
White
Fang
in
a
fury
of
righteous
wrath
But
now
his
waning
powers
would
not
permit
such
a
course
He
bristled
fiercely
and
looked
ominously
across
the
shinbone
at
White
Fang
And
White
Fang
resurrecting
quite
a
deal
of
the
old
awe
seemed
to
wilt
and
to
shrink
in
upon
himself
and
grow
small
as
he
cast
about
in
his
mind
for
a
way
to
beat
a
retreat
not
too
inglorious
And
right
here
Baseek
erred
Had
he
contented
himself
with
looking
fierce
and
ominous
all
would
have
been
well
White
Fang
on
the
verge
of
retreat
would
have
retreated
leaving
the
meat
to
him
But
Baseek
did
not
wait
He
considered
the
victory
already
his
and
stepped
forward
to
the
meat
As
he
bent
his
head
carelessly
to
smell
it
White
Fang
bristled
slightly
Even
then
it
was
not
too
late
for
Baseek
to
retrieve
the
situation
Had
he
merely
stood
over
the
meat
head
up
and
glowering
White
Fang
would
ultimately
have
slunk
away
But
the
fresh
meat
was
strong
in
Baseek’s
nostrils
and
greed
urged
him
to
take
a
bite
of
it
This
was
too
much
for
White
Fang
Fresh
upon
his
months
of
mastery
over
his
own
teammates
it
was
beyond
his
selfcontrol
to
stand
idly
by
while
another
devoured
the
meat
that
belonged
to
him
He
struck
after
his
custom
without
warning
With
the
first
slash
Baseek’s
right
ear
was
ripped
into
ribbons
He
was
astounded
at
the
suddenness
of
it
But
more
things
and
most
grievous
ones
were
happening
with
equal
suddenness
He
was
knocked
off
his
feet
His
throat
was
bitten
While
he
was
struggling
to
his
feet
the
young
dog
sank
teeth
twice
into
his
shoulder
The
swiftness
of
it
was
bewildering
He
made
a
futile
rush
at
White
Fang
clipping
the
empty
air
with
an
outraged
snap
The
next
moment
his
nose
was
laid
open
and
he
was
staggering
backward
away
from
the
meat
The
situation
was
now
reversed
White
Fang
stood
over
the
shinbone
bristling
and
menacing
while
Baseek
stood
a
little
way
off
preparing
to
retreat
He
dared
not
risk
a
fight
with
this
young
lightningflash
and
again
he
knew
and
more
bitterly
the
enfeeblement
of
oncoming
age
His
attempt
to
maintain
his
dignity
was
heroic
Calmly
turning
his
back
upon
young
dog
and
shinbone
as
though
both
were
beneath
his
notice
and
unworthy
of
his
consideration
he
stalked
grandly
away
Nor
until
well
out
of
sight
did
he
stop
to
lick
his
bleeding
wounds
The
effect
on
White
Fang
was
to
give
him
a
greater
faith
in
himself
and
a
greater
pride
He
walked
less
softly
among
the
grown
dogs
his
attitude
toward
them
was
less
compromising
Not
that
he
went
out
of
his
way
looking
for
trouble
Far
from
it
But
upon
his
way
he
demanded
consideration
He
stood
upon
his
right
to
go
his
way
unmolested
and
to
give
trail
to
no
dog
He
had
to
be
taken
into
account
that
was
all
He
was
no
longer
to
be
disregarded
and
ignored
as
was
the
lot
of
puppies
and
as
continued
to
be
the
lot
of
the
puppies
that
were
his
teammates
They
got
out
of
the
way
gave
trail
to
the
grown
dogs
and
gave
up
meat
to
them
under
compulsion
But
White
Fang
uncompanionable
solitary
morose
scarcely
looking
to
right
or
left
redoubtable
forbidding
of
aspect
remote
and
alien
was
accepted
as
an
equal
by
his
puzzled
elders
They
quickly
learned
to
leave
him
alone
neither
venturing
hostile
acts
nor
making
overtures
of
friendliness
If
they
left
him
alone
he
left
them
alone—a
state
of
affairs
that
they
found
after
a
few
encounters
to
be
preeminently
desirable
In
midsummer
White
Fang
had
an
experience
Trotting
along
in
his
silent
way
to
investigate
a
new
tepee
which
had
been
erected
on
the
edge
of
the
village
while
he
was
away
with
the
hunters
after
moose
he
came
full
upon
Kiche
He
paused
and
looked
at
her
He
remembered
her
vaguely
but
he
remembered
her
and
that
was
more
than
could
be
said
for
her
She
lifted
her
lip
at
him
in
the
old
snarl
of
menace
and
his
memory
became
clear
His
forgotten
cubhood
all
that
was
associated
with
that
familiar
snarl
rushed
back
to
him
Before
he
had
known
the
gods
she
had
been
to
him
the
centrepin
of
the
universe
The
old
familiar
feelings
of
that
time
came
back
upon
him
surged
up
within
him
He
bounded
towards
her
joyously
and
she
met
him
with
shrewd
fangs
that
laid
his
cheek
open
to
the
bone
He
did
not
understand
He
backed
away
bewildered
and
puzzled
But
it
was
not
Kiche’s
fault
A
wolfmother
was
not
made
to
remember
her
cubs
of
a
year
or
so
before
So
she
did
not
remember
White
Fang
He
was
a
strange
animal
an
intruder
and
her
present
litter
of
puppies
gave
her
the
right
to
resent
such
intrusion
One
of
the
puppies
sprawled
up
to
White
Fang
They
were
halfbrothers
only
they
did
not
know
it
White
Fang
sniffed
the
puppy
curiously
whereupon
Kiche
rushed
upon
him
gashing
his
face
a
second
time
He
backed
farther
away
All
the
old
memories
and
associations
died
down
again
and
passed
into
the
grave
from
which
they
had
been
resurrected
He
looked
at
Kiche
licking
her
puppy
and
stopping
now
and
then
to
snarl
at
him
She
was
without
value
to
him
He
had
learned
to
get
along
without
her
Her
meaning
was
forgotten
There
was
no
place
for
her
in
his
scheme
of
things
as
there
was
no
place
for
him
in
hers
He
was
still
standing
stupid
and
bewildered
the
memories
forgotten
wondering
what
it
was
all
about
when
Kiche
attacked
him
a
third
time
intent
on
driving
him
away
altogether
from
the
vicinity
And
White
Fang
allowed
himself
to
be
driven
away
This
was
a
female
of
his
kind
and
it
was
a
law
of
his
kind
that
the
males
must
not
fight
the
females
He
did
not
know
anything
about
this
law
for
it
was
no
generalisation
of
the
mind
not
a
something
acquired
by
experience
of
the
world
He
knew
it
as
a
secret
prompting
as
an
urge
of
instinct—of
the
same
instinct
that
made
him
howl
at
the
moon
and
stars
of
nights
and
that
made
him
fear
death
and
the
unknown
The
months
went
by
White
Fang
grew
stronger
heavier
and
more
compact
while
his
character
was
developing
along
the
lines
laid
down
by
his
heredity
and
his
environment
His
heredity
was
a
lifestuff
that
may
be
likened
to
clay
It
possessed
many
possibilities
was
capable
of
being
moulded
into
many
different
forms
Environment
served
to
model
the
clay
to
give
it
a
particular
form
Thus
had
White
Fang
never
come
in
to
the
fires
of
man
the
Wild
would
have
moulded
him
into
a
true
wolf
But
the
gods
had
given
him
a
different
environment
and
he
was
moulded
into
a
dog
that
was
rather
wolfish
but
that
was
a
dog
and
not
a
wolf
And
so
according
to
the
clay
of
his
nature
and
the
pressure
of
his
surroundings
his
character
was
being
moulded
into
a
certain
particular
shape
There
was
no
escaping
it
He
was
becoming
more
morose
more
uncompanionable
more
solitary
more
ferocious
while
the
dogs
were
learning
more
and
more
that
it
was
better
to
be
at
peace
with
him
than
at
war
and
Grey
Beaver
was
coming
to
prize
him
more
greatly
with
the
passage
of
each
day
White
Fang
seeming
to
sum
up
strength
in
all
his
qualities
nevertheless
suffered
from
one
besetting
weakness
He
could
not
stand
being
laughed
at
The
laughter
of
men
was
a
hateful
thing
They
might
laugh
among
themselves
about
anything
they
pleased
except
himself
and
he
did
not
mind
But
the
moment
laughter
was
turned
upon
him
he
would
fly
into
a
most
terrible
rage
Grave
dignified
sombre
a
laugh
made
him
frantic
to
ridiculousness
It
so
outraged
him
and
upset
him
that
for
hours
he
would
behave
like
a
demon
And
woe
to
the
dog
that
at
such
times
ran
foul
of
him
He
knew
the
law
too
well
to
take
it
out
of
Grey
Beaver
behind
Grey
Beaver
were
a
club
and
godhead
But
behind
the
dogs
there
was
nothing
but
space
and
into
this
space
they
flew
when
White
Fang
came
on
the
scene
made
mad
by
laughter
In
the
third
year
of
his
life
there
came
a
great
famine
to
the
Mackenzie
Indians
In
the
summer
the
fish
failed
In
the
winter
the
cariboo
forsook
their
accustomed
track
Moose
were
scarce
the
rabbits
almost
disappeared
hunting
and
preying
animals
perished
Denied
their
usual
foodsupply
weakened
by
hunger
they
fell
upon
and
devoured
one
another
Only
the
strong
survived
White
Fang’s
gods
were
always
hunting
animals
The
old
and
the
weak
of
them
died
of
hunger
There
was
wailing
in
the
village
where
the
women
and
children
went
without
in
order
that
what
little
they
had
might
go
into
the
bellies
of
the
lean
and
holloweyed
hunters
who
trod
the
forest
in
the
vain
pursuit
of
meat
To
such
extremity
were
the
gods
driven
that
they
ate
the
softtanned
leather
of
their
mocassins
and
mittens
while
the
dogs
ate
the
harnesses
off
their
backs
and
the
very
whiplashes
Also
the
dogs
ate
one
another
and
also
the
gods
ate
the
dogs
The
weakest
and
the
more
worthless
were
eaten
first
The
dogs
that
still
lived
looked
on
and
understood
A
few
of
the
boldest
and
wisest
forsook
the
fires
of
the
gods
which
had
now
become
a
shambles
and
fled
into
the
forest
where
in
the
end
they
starved
to
death
or
were
eaten
by
wolves
In
this
time
of
misery
White
Fang
too
stole
away
into
the
woods
He
was
better
fitted
for
the
life
than
the
other
dogs
for
he
had
the
training
of
his
cubhood
to
guide
him
Especially
adept
did
he
become
in
stalking
small
living
things
He
would
lie
concealed
for
hours
following
every
movement
of
a
cautious
treesquirrel
waiting
with
a
patience
as
huge
as
the
hunger
he
suffered
from
until
the
squirrel
ventured
out
upon
the
ground
Even
then
White
Fang
was
not
premature
He
waited
until
he
was
sure
of
striking
before
the
squirrel
could
gain
a
treerefuge
Then
and
not
until
then
would
he
flash
from
his
hidingplace
a
grey
projectile
incredibly
swift
never
failing
its
mark—the
fleeing
squirrel
that
fled
not
fast
enough
Successful
as
he
was
with
squirrels
there
was
one
difficulty
that
prevented
him
from
living
and
growing
fat
on
them
There
were
not
enough
squirrels
So
he
was
driven
to
hunt
still
smaller
things
So
acute
did
his
hunger
become
at
times
that
he
was
not
above
rooting
out
woodmice
from
their
burrows
in
the
ground
Nor
did
he
scorn
to
do
battle
with
a
weasel
as
hungry
as
himself
and
many
times
more
ferocious
In
the
worst
pinches
of
the
famine
he
stole
back
to
the
fires
of
the
gods
But
he
did
not
go
into
the
fires
He
lurked
in
the
forest
avoiding
discovery
and
robbing
the
snares
at
the
rare
intervals
when
game
was
caught
He
even
robbed
Grey
Beaver’s
snare
of
a
rabbit
at
a
time
when
Grey
Beaver
staggered
and
tottered
through
the
forest
sitting
down
often
to
rest
what
of
weakness
and
of
shortness
of
breath
One
day
While
Fang
encountered
a
young
wolf
gaunt
and
scrawny
loosejointed
with
famine
Had
he
not
been
hungry
himself
White
Fang
might
have
gone
with
him
and
eventually
found
his
way
into
the
pack
amongst
his
wild
brethren
As
it
was
he
ran
the
young
wolf
down
and
killed
and
ate
him
Fortune
seemed
to
favour
him
Always
when
hardest
pressed
for
